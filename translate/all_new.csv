BANKER_GREET,Hello dearie! Keen to do some banking?,
BANKER_REMEET,"Have you reconsidered opening an account? Losing Geo is a terrible thing.<page>You'll be much more confident out there in the big, dangerous world, knowing it's safe with me.",

BANKER_SPA_GREET,"Wah? Oh... you- you're back. I just thought, when you left, that was the last I'd... ahh... see of you.<page>It's just... ahh... your Geo issue. You should know, it was a big stress on me as well. Such a stress in fact, that I've left the banking game for good.",
BANKER_ACCT_DECLINE_AGAIN,"Still not interested? You're far too hesitant. Make bold decisions and follow them through, that's the trick to seeing your Geo grow. ",
BANKER_MEET,"Hello there dearie. I was about to close up shop and run, till you came along. I provide a banking service if you're interested.<page>Losing one's Geo is a terrible thing and it's so much more likely if you carry it about on yourself.<page>My vault is much more secure. In all my time as a banker, I've never lost a single Geo!<page>Maybe you'd considered opening an account?",
BANKER_SPA_MEET,"Oh...A-ah, hello again d-dearie. Fancy running into you he-here.<page>Is it your Geo you're after? We-ll you see, it's ahhhhh. It's a sad thing, but...It's gone. All spent.<page>The cost of running a bank can be high, so I had to charge a somewhat large service fee to your account.<page>Perfectly legitimate, of course. Just part of the whole banking deal...ah ha ha...ha.<page>But...ahh..thank you so much for visiting me, and run along now won't you. If you allow me some privacy, I'll be done here soon. Then you can have the spa all to yourself.",
BANKER_BALANCE_ZERO_REPEAT,...I think I might j-j-just rest right here a little while. Yes I think that would be best.,
BANKER_ACCT_DECLINE,I understand. It's difficult to part with hard won Geo. I'll be here if you change your mind.,
BANKER_ACCT_NOTENOUGH,"Oh, hang on. You don't have enough Geo to buy an account, sadly. Once you've collected 100 Geo, come straight back and we'll get your account opened up.",
BANKER_WITHDRAW,Thanks for the withdrawal. Don't go spending it all at once!,
BANKER_SPA_REPEAT,"...No h-hard feelings, okay?",
BANKER_DREAM,...When next to return to that delightful spa?...The waters so ease the tension in my shell...,
CHARMSLUG_TRUTH,"My dapper gadfly, would you care to know how charms are made? I don't often tell my customers, what with the truth being a little morbid. But you're a sharp one so you may have guessed already.<page>Few ways a charm appears but mainly it's from final wish, a dying bug's potent desire crystallised into these gorgeous, powerful trinkets.<page>Now don't go getting too sad. There are exceptions of course, and really, it's quite beautiful, makes them all the more precious. Mmhhmm.<page>Just think of all the little bug souls that went into creating your collection! It's like a crowd of strangers in your pouch, or purse, or...err....wherever it is you keep them.",
CHARMSLUG_DREAM,"...Dear dear, I really must hold it together, must appear calm, but this creature... is just divine...",
CHARMSLUG_MEET_3A,"Mmm... What were we talking about? Oh yes, Charms! I can see you've started your own collection. Very nice! I'll show you some of my own, and you can take one home with you if you like!",
CHARMSLUG_MEET_1,"Ooooooooooooohhhhhhh, you surprised me! Hello, hello! Come in, sweetling! Come in and make yourself at home.",
CHARMSLUG_MEET_3B,"Mmm... What were we talking about? Oh yes, Charms! I'm surprised a stylish little gadfly like yourself isn't wearing any, actually.<page>Charms are gorgeous, mystical, one-of-a-kind accessories with a spark of power woven into their cores. Just wearing one is enough to change your life! You'll do things you never thought possible!<page>Take a look at some of the Charms I have for sale. You can take one home with you if you like!",
CHARMSLUG_OVERCHARM,"It's a bit of a sin to wear too many Charms at once, isn't it? Sometimes less is more! Mmmm!<page>Yes, you shouldn't try to cram on more Charms than you can handle. The effect could be positively overwhelming!",
CHARMSLUG_COMBO,"Do you wear a lot of Charms at once? It's a lot of fun isn't it, mixing and matching them to get the perfect combination?<page>I don't know whether you've noticed, but some Charms seem to like each other. Yes! Mmm! When Charms like each other, they shine even brighter and sing even more sweetly!<page>Even more reason to try all sorts of fun and surprising combinations of Charms! Mmmmmmm! You'll show me whenever you have a new favourite, right?",
CHARMSLUG_BLESSING_1,"My dear. A blessing for you. With your excessive patronage and those startling good looks, you've more than earned it. ",
CHARMSLUG_NOSTOCK,"Goodness, goodness. You've gone and bought all my lovely charms! What a stunning, colourful collection you've amassed. Mmmmmm! You're even more the attractive bug, clad in all those wonderful, sparkling things.<page>I may have nothing more to give, but you must come back and visit from time to time. Such a dashing figure frequenting my store. I bet the whole village is jealous. Mmm hmm!",
CHARMSLUG_MEET_2,"I'm Salubra, and this is my cosy little Charm store. Did the townfolk out there tell you to come and visit me? Mmm, yes! This is a lovely little village isn't it? Warm and intimate and full of life.",
CHARMSLUG_NOTCH_AVAIL_1,"Ooooooooooooohhhhhhh, you're building up quite the Charm collection, aren't you? Quite the little connoisseur. I'd bet you'd like to wear more Charms at once, hmm? I've got a special item for sale that I think you'll be very, verrrry interested in! Mmm! ",
CHARMSLUG_NOTCH_AVAIL_2,"Oooohhhh! You flamboyant little gadfly! Your Charm collection has expanded quite a bit, hasn't it? I think it's about time you bought another Notch so you can wear more Charms at once. Go on... spoil yourself! Mmmm!",
CHARMSLUG_NOTCH_AVAIL_3,Oooohhhh! Your charm collection is getting positively enormous! I'm so jealous! I think it's about time you bought another Notch so you can wear more Charms at once. Go on... spoil yourself! Mmmm!,
CHARMSLUG_NOTCH_AVAIL_4,"Mmmmmmmmm! Look at you! Every time I see you, you've collected even more Charms! I think it's about time you bought another Notch so you can wear more Charms at once. Go on... spoil yourself! Mmmm!",
CHARMSLUG_BLESSING_2,Mmmmmm yess... I hope my blessing brings you everything you desire! Don't be a stranger sweetums.,
CHARMSLUG_REPEAT,"It's rare enough that someone enters my store, but even rarer to meet one so striking!<page>Those impressive horns! That fierce weapon. The air of mystery! Ooooh. It's enough to make me swoon.",
FUNGAL_WASTES_GREET,"Ahh my short friend, you've caught me at the perfect time. I'm just about finished charting these noxious caverns.<page>Very territorial types make their homes within this area. I'd suggest avoiding them where possible.<page>Further below some strange thin creatures gave me quite a scare. They seemed an intelligent bunch.<page>In my youth I'd have braved their caves but I fear my matured physique wouldn't be able to outrun them were they to turn violent.",
GREENPATH_GREET,"Isn't this a contrast from the Crossroads? Such a humid, lively place. The roads twist and turn in the most wonderful ways.<page>I've done my best to chart the area ahead, though I must admit some of the area's inhabitants proved quite a nuisance.",
CROSSROADS_BOUGHT,"How are you finding my map? I've tried to fill out as much as I can, but every map is a work in progress.<page>If you'd like to fill out some of the map yourself you can purchase some mapping supplies from my wife up in Dirtmouth. We've set up a little store to help make ends meet.",
MINES_GREET,Come to scale the mountain? I've heard tale of a summit way up there. Too far for me though and I'm not really one for heights. ,
CORNIFER_AGAIN_DP,Y-you want to buy a map after all?,
CROSSROADS_GREET,"Hello again! Still winding your way through these beautiful highways? Just imagine how they must have looked during the kingdom's height, thick with traffic and bustling with life! I wish I could have seen it.<page>Oh, and I suppose I should ask... are you interested in buying a copy of my map for this area...?",
FUNGAL_WASTES_BOUGHT,There's a potent odour about these caverns and far worse for me I suspect. My trunk is quite sensitive whereas you don't seem to possess a scent organ of any kind.<page>Is it that you cannot smell at all?,
CLIFFS_GREET,"Enjoying the bracing air? We're quite close to Hallownest's borders and those desolate plains that surround it. <page>In this direction, I'm about as far as I'm willing to go, though it's been a pleasant change from the tight confines of the caverns.<page>I've drawn out a small map for the area. It's a simple one and more for completion really. Not knowing the full extents of a region can be quite frustrating.",
FOG_CANYON_GREET,"Ho ho! As odd as much of Hallownest can be, there's a whole new level of strangeness about these caves.<page>Did you see that dark gate below? It's quite unsettling to be near. I did my best to avoid it.<page>Fortunate for me, I found another route in, though I did end up a little singed after wading through some acid.",
MINES_BOUGHT,I jabbed myself on one of those crystals back there. Awful sharp they are and all over the place. You'd best watch yourself if you're heading up. ,
WATERWAYS_BOUGHT,I'd wager these pipes and chambers were once used to carry the city's waste. Would've been a horrid stench down here. Thankfully that constant rain has flushed them clean. ,
DREAM,...To chart the world. What joy... If only Iselda could share the thrill...,
ABYSS_GREET,"Old caverns these ones. Can't you just feel the weight of the kingdom above? It's a heavy thing alright. <page>I reckon not many'd reach these depths. We're pioneers you and I, at least in recent history.",
CORNIFER_ISELDA,"A map can be a useful thing, but it alone won't show you where you are. If you've not the head for directions, I suggest purchasing a compass from my wife, Iselda.<page>She's just now opening our new map shop in Dirtmouth, selling all sorts of useful things to wanderers like yourself. She'll even sell some of my old maps from time to time.<page>I pop back to see her whenever I finish mapping an area. She's always so excited to see me.",
DEEPNEST_GREET,"This p-place gives me the creeps. Vicious little creatures burst out all o-over the place and the passages are a dark, twisting maze.<page>Unless you're well prepared, I'd urge you to leave, though if you're feeling strong enough to descend, would you like to buy my map?",
DEEPNEST_BOUGHT,W-w-what a horrid warren of angry beasts. It's going to take a whole lot of effort to climb out of this dark pit. I think I-I'll hide here a little longer. ,
FOG_CANYON_BOUGHT,"There's a large building just below here, out in the middle of a lake and a marvel to observe.<page>I tried to head in, but it's become a nest for those slimey, see-through creatures.<page>Ugh. They're just so... gross, and they give a nasty shock to touch. ",
CORNIFER_INTRO_1,"Oh, by the way, I haven't introduced myself have I? Yes, I should apologise for that. When you spend a lot of time by yourself, with just your own thoughts, you forget the niceties of conversation.",
CORNIFER_NOT_ENOUGH_DP,N-not enough Geo?,
CORNIFER_REFUSE_DP,N-not interested in the map?,
OUTSKIRTS_GREET,"Isn't this a cosy hole? I've been venturing about that wilderness beside here and thought a moment's break was well called for.<page>The landscape's all rather serene this side of the city, though the inhabitants are as ferocious as ever. ",
CITY_BOUGHT,"We've both come far to reach this grand place. While I'm about these buildings, I must remember to collect a trinket or two for Iselda.  ",
CORNIFER_REFUSE,"Not interested, then? Yes, quite understandable. Exploring without a map, finding your own way through unknown caverns... All very nourishing for the soul.<page>Perhaps we'll meet again on our travels.",
CORNIFER_INTRO_2,"My name is Cornifer, and I've always loved exploring the world. Why, when I was first hatched I wandered off immediately, leaving my brothers and sisters and poor mother behind! <page>That's why as soon as I could I moved to Dirtmouth with my wife. A huge, unending Kingdom to explore right on our doorstep. Who could resist?<page>Anyway, I'll let you return to your travels. With a little luck, we'll meet again. Be safe and farewell!",
CORNIFER_MEET_DP,"Hh-hello. I'm Cornifer. I'm a m-mapper by trade. I've tried to chart the dense nest beneath here b-b-but it's proving too dangerous for a bug like me.<page>Vicious little creatures burst out all o-over the place and the passages are a dark, twisting maze. Even with my good head for direction, I-I-I've had enough<page>Unless you're well prepared, I'd urge you to leave, though if you're feeling strong enough to descend, would you like to buy m-my meagre map?",
CARD,"Sorry I missed you! If you're feeling lost, why not pop up to our store in Dirtmouth and purchase a map of this area? Available now for an excellent price!<br>                                                             - Cornifer",

CORNIFER_PROMPT,Purchase a map of the area?,
CLIFFS_BOUGHT,I chanced upon a strange bug atop these cliffs. His house isn't far from here. <page>A very imposing figure he was and no doubt lethal with a Nail. I suspect you two might share more in common than him and I.,
ROYAL_GARDENS_BOUGHT,There's a Stag Station at the heart of these gardens. I would've taken my rest there if someone hadn't gone and locked the door. ,
GREENPATH_BOUGHT,"I ran into another traveller as I made my way down here. I tried to call out to her as she dashed past but she barely even glanced in my direction. Not an appreciater of maps like you and I, obviously.",

WATERWAYS_GREET,"Ho ho! Aren't these waterways thrilling? A labyrinth of pipes and tunnels.<page>I couldn't have asked for a better place to employ my talents. It's all so orderly, so considered, nothing like the crude irregularity of those caverns.<page>Ahh but so sad, my trunk is telling me those Fungal Wastes are close and I sense my damp adventure may have reached its end. Guess I'll be calling this map done.",
CORNIFER_AGAIN,Hmm? Have you changed your mind about buying a map?,
ABYSS_BOUGHT,It's a long trek back to the shop from here. I'll be resting my legs a little longer.<page>Not too long though! It won't do to have Iselda worrying after me.,
CITY_GREET,"Isn't this a change from those twisting natural caverns? The rain does cast something of a sadness upon it all but the architecture is simply splendid.<page>Charting such a different space is quite the challenge, though one I've eagerly undertaken.<page>Perhaps you'd care to purchase a copy of my achievements so far? ",
OUTSKIRTS_BOUGHT,"Judging by this wall, the city's folk seemed hesitant to build further into these caverns. I wonder what kept them at bay?",
CORNIFER_NOT_ENOUGH,"You don't have enough Geo? Ah, I understand. I'd give you the map as a gift, but I don't think my wife would be very happy if I did. ""All our food is made of Geo"", as they say.",

ISELDA_GRIMM,"Have you seen them? The travellers who set up camp outside of town?<page>I was interested at first, not a lot has been happening lately. But they have a... sinister feeling to them. You can feel it, right?<page>I've told Cornifer he's not to speak to them. His heart and his mind are a little too open sometimes.",
PROMPT_FRAGILE_HEART,Give Fragile Heart charm?,
IGOR_FINAL,...Mrmm.<page>Very good. The child burns with flame.<page>Master... is waiting for you. Mrmm.,
QUEEN_GRIMMCHILD,"Ahh, that creature beside. It would be naive to claim it friend, though you two share a... similarity? It is a distant link, one words would strain to convey.<page>For it to cling to you now...

BRUMM_LANTERN,"So you followed me here, to where the Ritual began. You would join me in breaking it then?<page>It is painful to defy the Master, but our harvest... it profanes this dark, quiet Kingdom. This once, I would see the Ritual fail.<page>Mrmm.. Now! Let us destroy the anchor, and banish the Master. Never shall he return here again!",
DIVINE_GRIMM_DEPARTED,"Ahhh! Then the Ritual is complete? And the Master has... moved on? Has he? Perhaps, not?<page>Ahhh, but more for me. Still more I can do. Gifts, so lovely! Aaaahh. Master would understand.",

BRUMM_DREAM_DEEPNEST,Yes. We are merely vessels for the flame. But... were we always empty?,
ELDERBUG_BRETTA_LEAVE,"That young lass! Why, she's up and departed over the cliffs, with only the briefest word of farewell.<page>It's a perilous journey she's set herself upon. I can't understand where she gained such fortitude.<page>I'd thought her a timid sort, one after my own mind... How wrong I was. The call of adventure lures all but me!",

NYMM_MEET,"Ah. Hello! Hello! I'm new around these parts, so it's marvelous to see so friendly a face, in such a sad town.<page>The old bug over there was very welcoming, but still I find the place a little melancholy, what with the wind, and the darkness, and the sense of decline... I was hoping my music could go some way to livening up the place.<page>And now you've arrived with that wonderful, charming aura about you. The whole town feels brighter for it.<page>Before you hurry about your business, I've a small gift to commemorate a wonderful new friendship.

I'm so glad you'd consider my gift worth wearing, and my, my, it does suit you well.<page>To be honest, I'm not even sure where I came upon it, but staring at its design, my memory stirs, something, and someone, forgotten, lost far away.<page>The specifics elude me, but a strange sense remains, fear, but also... longing? Like a strange nostalgia for something that never happened.<page>I've no need for it in any case, so I'm glad you're enjoying it.",

ELDERBUG_NYMM,"Ah ha! Good riddance! That creepy carnival has vanished and town's returned to its former self, nice and quiet as I like it.<page>And we've gained a new addition to the square! I found the fellow just outside of town. Seemed a little confused at first. Claims to be from far away, though he's hazy on the details.<page>Whatever his past, he's a rather good musician, and this town's spent far too long listening only to the wind. Thanks to him, we've gained a new tune and some new company!",
SLY_GRIMM,"I've been hearing about the strangers that have come to town. They're strange indeed from what's been told.<page>What interest does this tired little place hold for them?

JIJI_GRIMM,"Hmm. A fierce host has settled nearby. Did you summon them? I find their smell... unsettling.<page>Theirs is a scent of distant places, unfamiliar even to me.<page>They have a strange look to them, gaudy and intimidating. Perhaps you suspect they hide their true appearance? You'd be right. They favour projection over truth, shrouding themselves in forms dreamed.<page>Best be careful. Assisting them might benefit you, but who knows what suffering it may cause?",

That creepy carnival has vanished and the town's returned to its former self, nice and quiet as I like it.<page>It's quite enough to deal with just the occasional traveller.

Quite brazen to pilfer that special charm.<page>Amazing things the weavers once crafted on their looms; stories, shields, spells. So much of our history was spun upon their spools.

NYMM_FINAL,"Dear friend, I heard a violent scream from below. Even my song could not mask such a horrible shriek. Was it pain, or rage? I find I'm rather sensitive to such things.<page>If you're planning to head down, please do stay safe. I'd be dreadfully upset if I forever lost your company.",

WITCH_REWARD_8A,"Yes. The time has come. The Dream Nail... And you as well, Wielder. It is time for you both to awaken.<page>The Essence you have collected...The hope that still remains in this old Kingdom. Pure potential! Let it course through you and into the Dream Nail.<page>Hold it aloft, Wielder! Awaken! ",
WITCH_FINAL_1,"So much Essence... So bright.... You truly are the Wielder my tribe so long has dreamed of.<page>The folk of my tribe were born from a light. Light similar to Essence, similar to that powerful blade, though much brighter still.<page>They were content to bask in that light and honoured it... for a time.<page>But another light appeared in our world... A wyrm that took the form of a king.<page>How fickle my ancestors must have been. They forsook the light that spawned them. Turned their backs to it... Forgot it even.",
WITCH_MEET_A,"Ahhhh, you've returned. Welcome back to the waking world.",
WITCH_REWARD_5,"So, you already have 700 Essence. I wonder whether the Dreamers are watching you as you work. Or even that old King.<page>That lock of theirs. Desperate, but very clever. I wonder how long they thought it could hold?<page>I hold no disdain for them though. As history goes on I grow numb to its repetitions.<page>Take your gift and continue collecting Essence. Once you have 900, come back and visit me.",
WITCH_REWARD_7,"Yes, I thought so. More than 1500 Essence. The Dream Nail is close... so close to fully awakening!<page>Continue on your path, Wielder. I know not what guides you, nor what will it is that drives you forward. Once you have collected 1800 Essence though, I will be here waiting.<page>Take this gift, may it grant you strength and help you to collect the Essence of this world!",
WITCH_REWARD_4,"Ahhhhh. 500 Essence. You're a master in the making. Well done! Well done! I've a small reward for you.<page>Plucked from one of my most precious memories, this Charm will bring you and the Dream Nail closer together still. The secrets of this kingdom won't be able to hide from you any longer!<page>Take it, and return once you have collected 700 Essence. More gifts await you...",
WITCH_GENERIC,"This kingdom is full of old memories, both beautiful and grotesque. Seek them out, reveal them, and gather Essence.",
WITCH_MEET_B,"Ahhhh, you've found your way back to me. When you awoke you just up and left. I thought perhaps I'd frightened you.",
WITCH_REWARD_8B,"Ahhhh, ah ha, yes...<page>No dream can hide itself from you now. You can peer into the darkest places... You just need to find the right crack.<page>What will you do with such a power, Wielder? Whose memories will you hunt down?<page>Hah. Do as you wish, my promise is fulfilled. May the crimes of my tribe be washed away in time, like the rest of this Kingdom's...",
WITCH_FINAL_3,Aahh... I'm sorry...<page>Light... Radiance...<page>I... remember you.,
WITCH_INTRO,"Those figures, those Dreamers... they reached out with what little power they still have and dragged you into that hidden place.<page>But that talisman you now wield, the Dream Nail... it can cut through the veil that separates the waking world from our dreams. Even the Dreamers themselves can not hide from such a weapon.<page>Though I must admit, that sacred blade has dulled over time. Together perhaps, we can restore its power. You only have to bring me Essence.<page>Essence... the precious fragments of light that dreams are made of. Collect it wherever you find it, and bring it to me. Once we have enough, we can work wonders together.<page>Go out into the world, Wielder. Hunt down the Essence that lingers there!<page>Collect 100 Essence and return to me. I will teach you more...",
WITCH_REWARD_3,"So you've collected 300 Essence... Yes, I can see the dreams of this old Kingdom are starting to cling to you. Very encouraging.<page>You've certainly made my dreary work here more exciting. Being the caretaker of this place hasn't been very stimulating.<page>I shouldn't complain though. Tending these graves and guiding the Wielder... all penitence for old crimes. Certain things have to be kept in balance.<page>Take this trinket for your efforts, and return with 500 Essence. Keep up your tireless work!",
WITCH_FINAL_2,"And so this kingdom was born from that betrayal. But the memories of that ancient light still lingered, hush whispers of faith... Until all of Hallownest began to dream of that forgotten light.<page>Ah, but what's done is done. And so am I. The Wielder has at last appeared and I've held the memories of my tribe for long enough. It is time for us to be forgotten too.<page>Don't remember us, Wielder. Don't honour us. We do not deserve it...",
WITCH_HINT_DREAMPLANT,"Essence can be found wherever dreams take root.<page>Have you seen them? Those whispering plants that grow all over this old Kingdom? I believe there is one just outside. Why not strike it with your Dream Nail, and see what happens?",
WITCH_REWARD_1,"Hmm, already you've collected 100 Essence. Quick work! Things come naturally to you, don't they?<page>No wonder the Dreamers tried to bury you in that old dream. Perhaps you frighten them? Or perhaps, being prisoners themselves, they desired your company?<page>In any case, you still have a long way to go. Take this old trinket as encouragement from me, and return when you have collected 200 Essence.",
WITCH_REWARD_6,"The Dream Nail glows bright... It holds over 1200 Essence. Looking into it I can see so many memories peering back at me. So many asking to be remembered.<page>None of us can live forever, and so we ask those who survive to remember us.<page>Hold something in your mind and it lives on with you, but forget it and you seal it away forever. That is the only death that matters.<page>Huh, so they say! Enough of that though. Take this relic and come back to me with 1500 Essence. Go!",
WITCH_REWARD_2A,"Ahhh... Your Dream Nail holds over 200 Essence. You're proving your talent in its collection.<page>Have you seen that great door just outside? My tribe closed it long ago and forbade its opening.<page>Ah, but as far as I can tell I'm the only member of my tribe still breathing. That means I needn't feel bad about breaking a taboo. As proof of my belief in you, I'll open the door.",
WITCH_QUEST_1,Hm. You are still unpracticed in the way of dreams. Collect 100 Essence with the Dream Nail; visit me again and I will share what little wisdom I have.,
WITCH_QUEST_3,"You and the Dream Nail both seem a little sharper, but you still have a long way to go. Return to me once you have collected 300 Essence.",
WITCH_QUEST_2,"You and the Dream Nail both seem a little sharper, but you still have a long way to go. Return to me once you have collected 200 Essence.",
WITCH_QUEST_5,"Ah, you have learnt a lot about wielding the Dream Nail, haven't you? Return to me once you have collected 700 Essence and I will teach you more.",
WITCH_QUEST_4,"Ah, you have learnt a lot about wielding the Dream Nail, haven't you? Return to me once you have collected 500 Essence and I will teach you more.",
WITCH_QUEST_7,"Ahhh, the Dream Nail is glowing so brightly! Keep it up, return to me once you have collected 1500 Essence.",
WITCH_QUEST_6,"Ahhh, the Dream Nail is glowing so brightly! Keep it up. Return to me once you have collected 1200 Essence.",
WITCH_QUEST_9,"The Dream Nail has fully awoken, yet still you collect Essence. Perhaps I've instilled an obsession in you?<page>Keep at it, then! I'm happy to wait and watch your progress.<page>Once you have collected 2400 Essence, return to me. I've no more gifts to give... but you'd prove yourself the Wielder my tribe awaited.",
WITCH_QUEST_8,"Incredible... the Dream Nail, it is so close to fully awakening! Collect more Essence! Once you have 1800 Essence, something truly marvellous will happen!",
WITCH_REWARD_2B,"There, the door is open and you can enter the glade beyond it. Listen closely in there and you may hear the utterings of bugs long gone.",
WITCH_QUEST_5B,"My my, you're almost starting to become a dream yourself! Once you have collected 900 Essence I'll teach you a trick that I've kept hidden for a long time...",
WITCH_GREET,"Ah, Wielder, you've returned. Let me have a look at the Dream Nail...",
WITCH_REWARD_5B,"The Dream Nail now holds 900 Essence within its core! Are you surprised that this old kingdom has so many hidden dreams?<page>Yes, you're starting to see them. The connections between us and the dreams we leave behind, like prints in the dust. The time has come for you to learn how to revisit the places connected to you!<page>Hold the Dream Nail tight, wielder, and imagine a great gate opening before you!",
WITCH_HINT_XERO,"Sometimes dreams take the shape of those who have passed away. Such dreams are bountiful sources of Essence!<page>You should search carefully near graves and other monuments. Why, I believe I saw an interesting gravestone here in the Resting Grounds.<page>If you do decide to disturb those dreams though, be prepared for a fight...",
WITCH_DREAM1,"What a terrible fate they've visited upon you.<page>To cast you away into this space between body and soul.<page>Will you accept their judgement and fade slowly away?<page>Or will you take the weapon before you, and cut your way out of this sad, forgotten dream?",
WITCH_DREAM_FALL,"Though you may fall, your will shall carry you forward.<page>A dream is endless, but a Kingdom is not.<page>The power to wake this world from its slumber... you only need to reach out and take it.",
WITCH_DREAM,"What are you doing, poking about in a dusty old mind like mine? Nothing of worth is hidden inside, believe me.<page>But keep probing the world around you with your Dream Nail... Hidden things will reveal themselves.",

This little shadow...<br><br>Must return to its darkness.,,
DREAMERS_INSPECT_MONOMON2,A figure sleeps within the tank.,
ELDERBUG_CROSSROADS_INFECTED,"Ehhh...A sharp sickly smell has started to drift from the well beside town. I'd thought those depths ominous before, now they seem just dreadful.<page>Whatever horrid curse afflicts this ruin, I'd wager it's grown stronger than ever. ",
ELDERBUG_MINES_LIFT,"That noisy old lift, where does it go? Up to the old mines they carved into the peak, I suppose.<page>Have you been up there? Is it true that crystals grow everywhere you step?<page>A villager brought some of those crystals back to the village once. I don't quite understand the allure myself.<page>You can't eat them, and they don't make very good pillows. They hardly seem worth all the trouble to me.",
ELDERBUG_SHOPKEEP_RETURNED,"Oh, what a turn! Our shopkeep's come home. Just wandered back in. I'd hoped for grand tales of his time below, but he seems to remember almost nothing! Maybe it was all too much for him?<page>If you're interested in his wares, watch out! He drives a hard bargain, that one.<page>No competition. That's the problem. It's bad for the market. Not that he's complaining.",
ELDERBUG_DREAM,To descend into that ruin...Why? Things are so much simpler up here.,
ELDERBUG_STAG_STATION_GREET,There’s something about you little traveller. The winds are changing.,
ELDERBUG_FLOWER_REQUEST,"Hm? What's that you have there? Ah! What a beautiful flower!<page>I'd never have guessed by looking, but you have surprisingly good taste in flora. Why are you carrying around such an exquisite bloom?<page>Wait... you didn't...? Ahh!<page>This flower is... is it a gift? For me? Are you really giving me something so precious?",
ELDERBUG_INTRO_WALKEDBY,"Oh! You came back! You walked straight past me, I thought maybe I'd faded away along with this town.",
ELDERBUG_JIJI_DOOR,"Faring well in your adventures below? Well I had an adventure of my own while you were gone.<page>I don't usually visit the town's graveyard, but I thought I'd go and visit the grave of an old friend.<page>As I was walking amongst the tombstones, I noticed a strange kind of chanting coming from somewhere nearby. Extremely sinister chanting!<page>I looked around to find the source, and I saw two bright, horrible, huge eyes staring at me from the door of a dark cave!<page>I pretended I hadn't heard the voice or seen the eyes and scurried back to town. My friend will have to wait a little longer for her visit...",
ELDERBUG_DREAM_FLOWER,These petals... so white. Can you see them too... watching me from wherever you are?<page>Perhaps dreams aren't such bad things after all...,
ELDERBUG_GENERIC_1,"There's something strange about you. I've seen all types pass below, but you... You're almost familiar, though I'm sure we've never met before.",
ELDERBUG_KINGS_PASS,"To reach Dirtmouth, most travellers take circuitous routes around the cliffs beside us. It's a hard trek now but in the kingdom's prime things were far simpler.<page>There's an old pass in the cliffs that once allowed easy access. The bridge up to it has long since crumbled away, and even without it, a huge door bars entry.<page>I can't complain mind you. It's meant we've only ever had to accommodate a trickle of travellers, even during our busiest times.<page>I wouldn't want hordes of bugs to descend on Dirtmouth. I like the quiet.",
ELDERBUG_GOSSIP_HINT,"It's a sprawling land beneath us. If you're ever feeling lost or would care for some direction, come speak with me. I may be able to suggest a new sight or a new path you'd never before considered.<page>Suprised? Despite my lack of experience, I'm actually quite knowledgeable about the lay of the kingdom below. I've listened to countless stories from travellers and explorers just like yourself.<page>I'm sure you'll have your own grand tale to tell once you're finished down there. Either that or you'll be dead! I'll admit, in Hallownest, the latter is far more common.",
ELDERBUG_HINT_ANCIENT_BASIN,Did you know the caverns continue even below the capital? Few have ventured that deep so the details are scant.<page>Those who made it back told of impossibly old structures and roads formed as though the rock itself possessed a will.,
ELDERBUG_INTRO_VISITEDCROSSROAD,Oh! You're back! You walked straight past me and descended down into the ruins without even saying hello! I thought maybe I'd seen a ghost.<page>The mind sometimes plays tricks on you when you spend a lot of time alone.,
ELDERBUG_STAG_STATION_REOPENED,"I never thought I'd see such a thing. The Stag Station has opened! That building lay silent since before even my time.<page>Oh, I've heard the tales of the glorious lines. A web of tunnels running all through the kingdom. Not that I'll be travelling them, mind you!<page>I'm quite content where I am.",
ELDERBUG_HINT_CRYSTAL_PEAK,Did you see that tall cliff beyond the town's graveyard? That's only the base of a much larger peak.<page>There's mines and machinery and all sorts of valuable rock forms inside. Many a traveller through Dirtmouth headed straight for it.,
ELDERBUG_BLACK_EGG_OPENED,"I heard a piercing cry from the well. It echoed about my mind and left me all a daze.<page>I'd say it was a foul beast's death, but this cry sounded different...divine? Has something happened little traveller?<page>No. Don't tell me. If foul events are brewing, it's probably better I don't know.",
ELDERBUG_INTRO_NORMAL,"Ho there, traveller. I'm afraid there's only me left to offer welcome. Our town's fallen quiet you see.",
ELDERBUG_GENERIC_2,"Feeling tired? That bench may be iron, but I assure you it's quite comfortable. There's no better place to collect your thoughts before heading below. <page>Plus I enjoy the company. Not that you seem the talkative sort.",
ELDERBUG_DUNG,"Can you... smell something? There's suddenly a horrid stench in the air.<page>I swear, the town usually smells much nicer than this. Please accept my humble apology!",
ELDERBUG_FLOWER_ACCEPT,"Ah! I can really have it? My, my... I barely know what to say except... thank you!<page>I'd resigned myself to selflessly giving out advice to passers by, without receiving any gratitude in return. Little did I know, one young bug was taking my words to heart and would repay my kindness.<page>And with such a beautiful gift! Ahh. Suddenly, the world seems a little less faded.<page>Thank you, my friend. I will take care of this flower while you're gone, so we can enjoy it together when you return.",
ELDERBUG_HINT_FUNGAL_WASTES,"My understanding of Hallownest can be a little vague, but below those leafy caverns is a fungal grove, once home to peaceful creatures not quite bug and not quite plant.<page>Sounds almost worth a visit no? Well there's a downside, the dreadful stench! A noxious odour fills the place. ",
ELDERBUG_HISTORY_2,"I hope you aren't too disappointed by our little town, traveller. Though it's now a solemn place, once we were much more welcoming.<page>Entry to the kingdom was forbidden long ago, supposedly after some great calamity. Many gates were closed, but our old well remains as a way to creep back in.<page>Over the years, all kinds used the well to wriggle into the ruins, wanderers, thieves, adventurers.<page>Funny how few ever come back up. Perhaps they find what they're looking for?..<page>Bah, I'm not so naive. No doubt, they've all been gobbled up! There are countless dangers in those depths.",
ELDERBUG_HISTORY_1,"Many used to come, hoping the kingdom would fulfill their desires. <page>Hallownest, it was once called. Supposedly the greatest kingdom there ever was, full of treasures and secrets.<page>Hm. Now it's nothing more than a poisonous tomb full of monsters and madness.<page>Everything fades eventually, I suppose.",
ELDERBUG_HINT_GREENPATH,"I used to think the kingdom below was all dead cold rock, but I've since been told different. Travellers speak of startling variety in Hallownest's caverns. Even just besides those Crossroads there's meant to be an area filled with leafy greenery.<page>I told those same travellers about the wonderful grasses that grow around the town. They didn't seem impressed. ",
ELDERBUG_FLOWER_DECLINE,Oh. My mistake. Yes. Very foolish of me. I don't know why I thought you'd go to so much effort for a simple old bug.<page>Appreciating others and being considerate... these aren't skills that everyone is born with.,
ELDERBUG_FLOWER_GENERIC,This flower you gave me... when dark thoughts creep into my head I gaze at it and think of you.<page>Why not rest at the bench here for a while? We can enjoy the flower together before you head off again.,
ELDERBUG_BRETTA_RETURNED,"That lovely young lass returned to us!<page>I must admit, I'd placed thin odds on her survival.<page>Seems to think very highly of her rescuer, some sort of dashing, warrior type. Barely stopped gushing since she got back.<page>The warrior must have passed down below whilst I was taking my nap. Such a shame. I'd have loved to meet so impressive a bug.",
ELDERBUG_INTRO_MAIN,"The other residents, they've all disappeared. Headed down that well, one by one, into the caverns below.<page>Used to be there was a great kingdom beneath our town. It's long fell to ruin, yet it still draws folks into its depths.<page>Wealth, glory, enlightenment, that darkness seems to promise all things. I'm sure you too seek your dreams down there.<page>Well watch out. It's a sickly air that fills the place. Creatures turn mad and travellers are robbed of their memories.<page>Perhaps dreams aren't such great things after all...",
ELDERBUG_HINT_CITY_OF_TEARS,"Hallownest's great capital is what most of you brave types come to see. Thinking to loot its treasures I suppose? It must be brimming with them.<page>The city's right at the centre of the kingdom, though I've heard the gates are sealed, so gaining entry can be difficult.<page>It'd be a rich bug that could return with even a fraction of the wealth inside. Despite my age, I've only seen few who've managed it. Must say something of the dangers about its streets.",
ELDERBUG_TOWN_GREET_4,"If you do meet my fellows down there you might remind them of their poor Elder, up here, back aching, abandoned to his lonesome vigil. Poor poor me!...<page>Oh I'm fine, really, but a bit of guilt might go some way in persuading their return. Assuming they're still alive that is.",
ELDERBUG_FLOWER_REREQUEST,You're still holding onto that exquisite bloom... have you changed your mind? Are you really giving me something so precious?,
ELDERBUG_MAP_SHOP_OPEN,"A young couple's just recently taken up residence in the house beside the station. Seems they're running a map shop, which may excite adventurous types like yourself.<page>She's a tall bug, the wife. I told them to take a larger house, especially given they're all empty, but they liked the look of that one.<page>The way she has to bend just to get through the door...I wouldn't put up with it myself.",
ELDERBUG_TEMPLE_VISITED,"Did you visit that temple? A strange building I've heard, though I'd never dare the journey myself.<page>The braver among us once went there to pray, said they felt at peace within the walls. After a while, they stopped going. I wonder what changed?",
ELDERBUG_HINT_RESTING_GROUNDS,"Apparently, the many graves of Hallownest are enough to fill an entire network of caverns. Somewhere above the city it's told. Sounds a gloomy sight.<page>Bah, I'm content with our own humble plot. In our boom times, we even had a gravedigger! Not a bad sort he was, though dead now.<page>He, didn't die to the dangers of Hallownest mind you. That one fell into an open grave and couldn't climb out.<page>I found the corpse myself. Dreadful nuisance. I've since had to tend the graves myself.",
ELDERBUG_TOWN_GREET_3,"Feeling tired? That bench may be iron, but I assure you it’s quite comfortable. There's no better place to collect your thoughts before heading below.<page>Plus, I'd enjoy the company, even if you're not the most talkative sort.",

PROLOGUE_EXCERPT_04,โลกที่คุณมอบให้แมลงและสัตว์ร้าย อย่างที่พวกเขาไม่เคยนึกฝัน,
HU_INSPECT,We remember the Elder.,
CHAGAX_TALK,I used to help others. They were brought to me sick and dying... What difference did it make?...<page>Any victory against death will always be temporary.,
HU_DEFEAT,"My mind... it clears. Have we been... sleeping, child?<page>Aah... I remember. Those proud lords... were they truly monsters? I remember their eyes now... bright and clear. Why then did I fear them so?<page>If there was madness in that village, it was I who brought it. They were right to cast me out.<page>When I attacked, they were right to...<page>They were right to kill...<page>To kill... me...?<page>...aah.",
MOLTEN_TALK,Don't fear my rotting form. Though my body sheds and changes my core remains the same.,
KCIN_REPEAT,Seeking power is a hollow goal. Best to search for other things.,
HEX_REPEAT,Go bother someone else. You're not the one I'm waiting for.,
XERO_REPEAT,"Do you still hope, wanderer? Will you flee? Or will you raise your weapon and doom us both?",
GROHAC_TALK,"We're always left with reminders of the errors we've made. Let your mistakes not burden you, but serve as guideposts on where not to travel.",
GALIEN_REPEAT,So then... shall we do battle? Let us test our strength in joyful combat!,
KARINA_TALK,"Are you admiring my fabulous markings? I'm of a distinguished species you see, though I've not seen another like me for the longest time.",
THISTLEWIND_TALK,"Ahhh, a wanderer.<page>I've been many places and done a great many things, but I suspect you will outdo me by far.<page>I've long ceased travelling the caverns of Hallownest and I suspect they're now far more dangerous than in my journeys, though with your capable air I'm sure you'll do fine.<page>Good luck! It's a vast world out there.",
WAYNER_TALK,"Hark, fellow adventurer! Are you heading out into the world? I'd join you, but it's been so long, I fear I'd lose my head.",
ALADAR_INSPECT,"Here lies Gorb, the Great Mind.",
MUMCAT_TALK,"Oh! The Queen! The Queen is coming! I've been waiting so long, and now she's almost here! I feel like I'm about to burst!<page>I've kept it safe, this sacred garden! I've kept it safe for all this time, and soon the Queen will return and teach me to fly!<page>Shall we wait together, stranger? Shall we play together?",
PERPETOS_TALK,"Are you enjoying your time in our glade? I'd offer advice, though to have made it here you're obviously quite adept at navigating our world and its perils.",
GARRO_REPEAT,Stand strong little warrior.,
GRASSHOPPER_TALK,"Isn't this just the most intriguing place? So many discoveries waiting to be made. We're about to set off ourselves, though we can't seem to agree on which way to head.<page>It's led to something of an argument between us. We should really stop squabbling about such petty things. ",
100NAIL_TALK,"Do you like my nails little wanderer? I carry only three, far less than legends may suggest.<page>Still! Each is sharper than the last and I'd require only one to cut you down. ",
MILLY_REPEAT,Buy my cookies! Once I've sold them all I can go home.,
MAGNUS_TALK,"All of life's problems can be solved with crushing force. Such a simple mantra and one I've always lived by.<page>If you weren't so scrawny, I'd suggest you follow my example.",
ATRA_REPEAT,My appearance should not cause you worry. Here I am truly at peace.,
GALIEN_DEFEAT,"Unbelievable... I am defeated at last! So this is what it feels like to be bested...<page>Still though, I am strong, am I not? When you see our King, surely you'll tell him of my valour...?<page>Yes... he sent you here to test me, didn't he? I knew he had not forgotten brave Galien.<page>I am ready... to join you now. Brothers, you and I. Let us leave this place...<page>...together...",
GALIEN_INSPECT,The body of a fallen warrior.,
NOEYES_REPEAT,"Precious children, a monster has come for us in the dark...Will you sing for me?",
HU_REPEAT,"Beware dreams of glory, child. Turn back, and do not return.",
PERPETOS_REPEAT,"You're very impressive for such a small thing. I'm something of a warrior myself, though even I'd hesitate to raise my nail against you.",
GRAVEDIGGER_REPEAT,Do as you will little wanderer. Cut a path toward your goal.<page>I shouldn't complain. It's your kind that keeps folks like me in business.,
MARKOTH_TALK,"You have come a long way, just to die here at the edge of the world.<page>No, do not speak. I have heard thousands and thousands of empty words from those like you. Your pride, your desires, your desperation... you will take these things with you once I strike you down.<page>Raise your weapon then, and die like those who came before you.",
MARISSA_REPEAT,"Even if only you, it's a wonderful thing to have an audience again.",
NOEYES_INSPECT,A face carved from stone.,
HIVEQUEEN_TALK,"Small thing. I know your kind.<page>If you attempt to resolve your past then know I am not the queen you seek.<page>It is the pale beings that bear blame for your nature.<page>Though this hive exists within Hallownest, we play no part in its attempt at perpetuation.",
XERO_DEFEAT,Ah... I can see now. Those who turn against the King are doomed as soon as they raise their weapon.<page>Do not call me a traitor. Simply call me a fool.<page>I know you will not flee. Wherever you go... I will be watching.,
MUMCAT_DEFEAT,"Oh, stranger... you're strong. Much stronger than me...<page>I've been waiting a long time, stranger. I've been fighting a long time, stranger.<page>I'm very, very tired! The Queen will be here soon, and I just need to sleep a little.<page>Wake me when the Queen arrives, stranger. Perhaps the Queen will teach us both to fly, stranger!<page>That... would be fun... wouldn't it...?",
BOSS_TALK,"I came from far away to reach this place. Though my shell may seem foreign, beneath it I am a bug the same as you.",
MAGNUS_REPEAT,"Remember tiny bug, crush your fears; crush your problems; crush your foes.",
REVEK_TALK,"The bugs within this glade are under my watch. Treat them with respect and you may remain, but raise your nail and you'll contend with me.",
ATRA_TALK,Don't fear little creature. Though a violent rage once possessed me the peaceful air in this place seems to keep it at bay. ,
MUMCAT_REPEAT,"Shall we wait together, stranger? Shall we play together?",
XERO_TALK,"Stop there! Those who try to leave this kingdom are cursed. Better to rest here, until time itself sleeps.<page>Hope and freedom. I thought that strength alone could grant me these things. In my dreams I would cut that plague with my nails, and then I turned my weapons upon the King.<page>When I awoke in this sacred place, I began to understand. Those who hope are already doomed.<page>Do you still hope, wanderer? Will you flee? Or will you raise your weapon and doom us both?",
WYATT_TALK,"Watch out!<page>I've an acidic touch and I wouldn't want you getting burned. It's a protection system of my kind, though something of a nuisance when it comes to meeting others.",
HIVEQUEEN_EXTRA,My Knight... At last you are freed.,
MAGE_LORD,"In my dreams I could see it. The Kingdom's salvation, the cure for the plague... the answer was in the soul that animates our bodies.<page>But the King... why?! He opposed everything I did...<page>His jealousy... his madness... by standing against me he robbed me of my immortality!<page>Now the King and his Kingdom are dead... but I... will live forever.",
MARKOTH_INSPECT,"The body of a warrior, with a shield and nails.",
HIVEQUEEN_REPEAT,To rail against nature is folly. All things must accept an end. ,
REVEK_TALK_DEFEAT_REPEAT,"To protect? Was that my task? If so, who was I protecting? It's only you and me here. ",
MARISSA_TALK,"Welcome to my stage little one. I am Marissa, a songstress of some renown, though given the sorry state of this place, you may find it hard to believe. <page>Huge crowds once flocked to hear me sing, then something changed. The audience, once so enrapt, began to leave. I continued to sing yet my voice fell silent upon their ears.<page>Perhaps you'd care to listen to me sing? You'll be the first in an age to hear it.",
GRASSHOPPER_REPEAT,"Left or right? Which way is best? It should be a simple thing, yet we're always at odds.  ",
XERO_INSPECT,Cursed are those who turn against the King.,
WALDIE_REPEAT,You wouldn't have the guts to face me anyway.,
GROHAC_REPEAT,"These husks around my neck? They're my precious friends, always there to keep me company and much better for conversation than the rest of the odd lot around here.",
MOLTEN_REPEAT,Though my body sheds and changes my core remains the same.,
CHAGAX_REPEAT,Any victory against death will always be temporary.... What a gloomy thought.,
MARKOTH_REPEAT,"Raise your weapon then, fool, and die like those who came before you.",
NOEYES_TALK,"My child... can you still see? Please, don't hurt me.<page>Can't sleep... with your eyes open, little one. Can't dream... if you're still breathing, little one.<page>Precious children... you speak such loathsome things as you sleep... your claws scratch and scrape...<page>Precious children, a monster has come for us in the dark...Will you sing for me?",
JONI_TALK,"Ahhh, I see you bear my blessing. I can't remember giving it, but my memory has been a little lacking of late.",
ALADAR_DEFEAT,I... am Gorb!<page>The great mind... the pain! Ascend! Ascend!<page>I... I am...,
GRAVEDIGGER_TALK,Ehh... Another wielding a weapon. I suppose you'll be leaving many a corpse in your wake?<page> If you won't spare thought for the dead at least consider all the extra work you force upon those in my profession.  ,
MILLY_TALK,Buy my cookies! They're ever so tasty.,

Below shining horns, eyes welled black, glistening, eyes only for the maiden long missed, long desired.<page>Her saviour leaned close, sat beside, perfectly composed. In that charged, breathless moment not a word needed be spoken, <page>The maiden's shell felt suddenly tight. Her claws curled. No glance was shared, no claws touched, just perfect, aching love shared in silence, together...",

JINN_DREAM,"Does Jinn dream?... What purpose, mine?... To serve, enough?",
JINN_OFFER,...Would It offer gift so wonderful to Jinn...?,
TISO_BENCH_GREET,Ehh. Pale thing. You use these old lines? Pathetic. A real warrior carries himself to combat. He has no need for such convenience.,
BIGCAT_DREAM,One prefers its mind not be pried. Is rather unsettling. Rather invasive.,
KING_ABYSS_FINAL_C,You are the Hollow Knight.,
BRETTA_DREAM_BED,White Wanderer...don't be shy....cold outside....bed is soft... ,
BIGCAT_INTRO,"Ohrm... Tiny thing. You climb high. Seek then knowledge of these lands?<page>This ashen place is grave of Wyrm. Once told, it came to die. But what is death for that ancient being? More transformation methinks.<page>This failed kingdom is product of the being spawned from that event.",
JINN_RETURN,...It came back. Does it remember Jinn? Will It offer a gift? Trade for useless shinies?,

There's not so much to say. I'm a servant to the nest, though few in recent times would seek my service.<page>Our brood is lost to that pestilence of the mind. A sad fall for the most intelligent species. <page>Ah, but hmmm. I've eaten yes, and full. Then again, another little morsel would make me oh so happy. The perfect end to a meal...",
TISO_TOWN_GREET,"Pale thing. You wear that nail with ease. If you're in search of combat, you'll find no great warriors in this decaying burrow. <page>I've heard an arena exists somewhere below.

LITTLE_FOOL_CHAMP,"A true fool keeps on fighting, even when there is no more glory to be gained. Step over to a board and make your mark! Show us how foolish you truly are!",
EMILITIA_MEET,"Ah, what a surprise! It's not often I receive visitors. It's been so long. Ages even. I just hope my manners haven't left me.<page>You've no doubt sensed my affluence. You're right to guess, I'm renowned amongst the upper caste of Hallownest.<page>...Well I was... once, until those cretins cast me out.<page>Have you met them, my former fellows?

XUN_HAVE_FLOWER,"Her grave lies in the middle of the Queen's old retreat, a far journey from here and the roads between are fraught with beasts.<page>Safe tiding on your journey. My heart does flutter to feel such kindness from so tiny a creature.",
BRETTA_DREAM_DAZED,...Shining figure...So bright...,
CLOTH_GHOST,"Well now that was something! A true battle of mighty warriors. So intense. So climactic. It's really everything I could have ever hoped for.<page>Thanks for all your help, my friend. For a tiny bug you set a valiant example. We'll meet again, I'm sure of it. ",
MASK_MAKER_UNMASK4,I see another takes mantle of king? Then grim responsibility that shall bestow.<page>No bug has ever laid claim to this whole. Even the beasts knew their limits and bound their realm at Nest's edge.<page>It is the ancient caste that made attempt at such vast rule. Hallownest's ruin reflects well those fared attempts.,
LEGEATER_REFUSE_AGAIN,"Still?! You're a greedy, nasty little wretch. You need to share your Geo...",
EMILITIA_GREET,"In times past I wouldn't have spoken with your likes, but now the rest of my caste are wonderfully, distantly deceased.<page>If I didn't welcome you I'd never have anyone to share my happiness with.",

SPIDER_DREAM,Gah!! Get out! Get out! Get out!,
CLOTH_TRAMWAY_GREET,"My friend, you dealt with all of those beasts?<page>I'm ashamed to say... I was hiding. Those ghastly things chased me and I ran. If you hadn't come along, who knows if I'd ever have survived.<page>Others take me for a fearsome warrior, what with my impressive size, but this kingdom's beasts, I wonder if I'm just no match for them?...",
XUN_MEET,"Ahhhh.... Me'hon. This world. This cruel, sinful world. Why does che' wake? Why does che' persist?<page>Ahhh Le'mer, you could not know of tragedy as complete as che's, true lovers stripped apart, two worlds that could not meet.<page>And now meled'lover, dead so long in time. Dead, so far away. Buried, moina? Ai. Amongst its hateful kin that did deny our union, that did reject che's... outside-ness.<page>She doesn't suppose?... Nahlo, Nahlo. Could che' ask? Could che' burden?<page>Le'mer, woulds't you, coulds't you deliver gift to her grave?<page>The gift is, maybe small? But the trek is long. She rests amongst her kind near our Queen's lush refuge.<page>Would such a thing be done? Che' asks perhaps impossible things? Mad things? For Le'mer to take up such quest would be a kindness che' has near forgotten. ",
DUNG_DEFENDER_DUNG_CHARM,"Ahh. You exude the proud odour of the Just. Truly, a mighty Knight you are. ",
TUK_DUNG,"Mmnnnnggghhh...? Your smell... Are you a friend, too? If you're a friend, I'll share my food with you.<page>When you see him again, our friend... tell him thank you. For helping me.",
CLOTH_TOWN_REPEAT,"I'll be off soon. It's a dangerous thing to trek the desolate sands beyond the kingdom. I'll need all my strength to survive them.<page>First though, a good rest is in order.",
MR_MUSHROOM_EXCUSE,...Oh. Excuse me.,
TUK_GREET,"Mmmnnnnnnngghhh... The water brings me everything I wish for... I just need to find it.<page>It brought you here, too. Are you hungry? I'll share my food with you... if you give me Geo.",
XUN_ACCEPT,"Rare boon you grant Le'mer. It will be che's last request. After this, never shall che' lay burden on another.<page>A sacred flower is the offering. It is a rare, delicate object. One of a kind. You must cherish it, must act as though it were your own heart.<page>If you were to get hurt whilst carrying it, or did to attempt ride those jolting transit beasts, it would forever be destroyed.<page>Her grave lies in the middle of the Queen's overgrown estate. It is surrounded by her kind, who will not look kindly on your trespass.<page>Take care Le'mer. My hopes I place upon you and my fervent wish that this small solace may come to pass.",
TISO_DREAM_BENCH,Those old stags could've been ferocious fighters. If only they weren't so servile...,
JINN_SHADE_CHARM,"This It... A rare It. Has not seen many, so vulnerable, but triumphant. Makes Jinn feel a thing... surprise?<page>Jinn misjudged... The It is not inferior. Perhaps... different? Different to Jinn. More complete? Different... like masters?",
MR_MUSHROOM_FINAL,"...Oh. I see. So you've been following me around then? I hope my travels haven't confused your own, distracted you.<page>Then again, a meandered journey still has meaning. It is, after all, from a journey we find our purpose, though a stop is more than just a stop.<page>And my if those stops can't be lovely things, wouldn't you say? Transcendant plateaus, distant sandy lands, vast ancient kingdoms. Yours was not the first, nor will it be the last, but it's a unique and special thing nonetheless.<page>Now, with my duties here finished, it's time I made graceful departure. Till next time my friend. Tis a long road we tread, but a joyous one.",
TISO_DREAM_LAKE,"That place calls to me. Somewhere beyond this lake, perhaps?",
CLOTH_QG_DREAM,It's time! I'll face that fear. Nola will be proud.,
CLOTH_FUNG_REPEAT,Keep sharp my adventurous friend. Stay alive and let's meet again on the road ahead.,
DUNG_UNDERGROUND_2,"My cave may seem a far cry from the finery of the palace but even still the memories of my former comrades, and our glorious King, remain fresh in my mind.<page>The Pale Court was a wondrous place full of the age's greatest heroes.

BRETTA_ZOTE,Grey Prince...So dark...So troubled...,
TISO_COLOSSEUM,"Pale one. You found it too then, this perfect place. I'll soon be entering the battle. Just taking a moment to rest first.<page>Though few could truly challenge me, I'm hoping this arena presents the sort of brutal challenge I'm after.",
BIGCAT_KING_BRAND,Tiny thing... Oh hmm... The mark of Wyrm you bear. Is it change you seek? Or to save this ruin?<page>That choice is yours. Always the smallest creatures that attempts the largest things.,

LEGEATER_BROKEN,"Eeeauuggh! You broke it! I gave you that charm as a gift, and you broke it! Clumsy little fool... Nasty.<page>Apologise, ask me nicely, and I'll fix it for you. Give me Geo and I'll fix it for you.",
DUNG_UNDERGROUND_DREAM,Where will the line of Hallownest's Great Knights end? With me? Can such a thing be passed on?,
LEGEATER_CONVO5,Are you curious? You're wondering... how I make my special gifts.<page>Eeeauuggh! Don't try to steal my secrets! I'll steal them right back.<page>If you're cruel to me... you'll be sorry. ,

I, Nailmaster Mato, who was taught the Art of the Nail by the Great Nailsage himself, hereby accept you as my pupil! Let us begin the lesson immediately!",
SHEO_REFUSE,"Oh? Have you, too, grown weary of the weight of a nail? I understand. Stay, if you like, and we can make art together.",
SHEO_MEET,"A visitor! Why have you crept in here, little grub? Perhaps, like me, you have a taste for discovering new things?<page>I am Sheo, and in a previous life I was a Nailmaster. Yes, the only thing that drove me was becoming stronger and honing my skills with a nail.<page>I imagined it was my one calling in life, but that feeling faded over time. Now I seek a new calling, something that speaks to my soul and compels me forward.<page>That's why I spend my time here, secluded, trying to master the art of creation. Painting, sculpting... these things bring a different kind of pleasure.<page>Mmm. You don't seem very moved by what I've said. Was it Sheo the Nailmaster you were looking for? Did you come to learn a Nail Art? I'll teach you if you insist...",
MATO_TAUGHT,"Your form... exquisite! Now I know how my own master felt when he passed down his teachings to us.<page>I hope you don't think me too forward when I say that I consider you to be my child. Yes! When I saw you perform my Nail Art I felt a bond between us suddenly flash into existence!<page>You honour me beyond words, my pupil...<page>Thank you.",
SHEO_ORO,"So you met my brother Oro and convinced him to teach you his Nail Art. Hmm.<page>It's been a long time since I've seen him. I wonder how much he's changed. He always seemed to be haunted by something, though I never learned what.<page>No matter the distance between us though, we are still brothers. I hope that passing down his learnings to you brought him some happiness.",
SHEO_TAUGHT,"So! My work, does it move you?<page>The wielding of a nail, the wielding of a brush... these things are not so different.<page>We cut into the world so that we can peer deeper inside.<page>For now though, I have nothing more to teach you. Your path forwards... only you can see it. Good luck.",
NAILSMITH_MEET_1,"Have you brought me another nail to be honed? Leave it on the ground and return later, if you're still breathing.",
NAILSMITH_DECLINE,"You're not interested, then? Suit yourself.",
ART_DREAM,....An age spent toiling alone... this is much nicer...,
MODELLING,"We're building a full suite of the Kingdom's Knights. In their time, I barely ever paid them attention, but Sheo keenly remembers each.<page>It's so refreshing. Nothing like the crude practice of Nailwork. I just love all the intricate details.",
NAILSMITH_OFFER,"If you'd like, I can reforge your nail. It'll make the blade far more deadly.",
NAILSMITH_COMPLETE_3,Here we are. The reforging is complete.<page>I've modified the nail to spiral form. A very tricky task it was. You'll find it stronger than ever before.<page>Off you go now. Cut your way forward.,
NAILSMITH_GREET,"Hmm? Oh, you've returned.",
NAILSMITH_COMPLETE_1,There we go. The reforging is complete.<page>I've honed your nail's edge. You'll find it much stronger than it used to be.<page>Head out there and test its strength against your foes.,
PAINTED_REPEAT,"In all the dark of Hallownest, who'd have thought I'd meet such an inspiring soul.",
NAILSMITH_COMPLETE_4,"It's done. The reforging is done.<page>Your nail is much stronger than it used to be. As strong as it could ever be.<page>In only your weapon have I seen such potential. Finally, I behold the majesty of a Pure Nail. <page>To think this moment has come upon me so soon...<page>...I... I must step outside a moment...",
NAILSMITH_COMPLETE_2,There we go. The reforging is complete.<page>I've added a channel to your nail. It should cut much more efficiently. You'll find it stronger than it used to be.<page>Head out there and test its blade against your foes.,
NAILSMITH_REGREET,Hmm? You're still here. Is there something else you want?,
NAILSMITH_ACCEPT,As you wish. I'll get to work then.,
NAILSMITH_KILL_REPEAT,Do not hesitate. I beg you. Cut me down! I want to taste that blade's exquisite edge.,
ART_MEET,"Hmm? Oh, hello traveller. How strange that we should meet again in a world as vast as this.<page>I must thank you for not killing me when I asked you to. I was irritated at first, but I had some time to think up there and I soon saw the wisdom in your decision.<page>The world is made of more than metal and weapons. I set out exploring, and soon found my way here.<page>Sheo is a master of many arts, and has promised to teach me what he can. I think I'll be quite happy here.",
NAILSMITH_SIGN,Unused,
MODELLING_REPEAT,This is fabulous. I'd never have believed my claws capable of such deft construction.,
NAILSMITH_NEED_ORE1,"If you bring me a piece of Pale Ore, I can forge it into your nail and make it stronger still.",
NAILSMITH_NEED_ORE3,"If you bring me three pieces of Pale Ore, I can forge it into your nail and make it stronger still.",
NAILSMITH_NEED_ORE2,"If you bring me two pieces of Pale Ore, I can forge it into your nail and make it stronger still.",
NAILSMITH_KILL,"With a Pure Nail forged, my work in this lifetime comes to an end. My only remaining desire is to see and feel the nail strike true!<page>I beg you, cut me down. As my final moment in life, I want to taste the blade's exquisite edge.<page>After all this time, all this toil... haven't I earned it?",
NAILSMITH_NOT_ENOUGH_GEO,"Ah, you don't have the Geo? Come and see me when you do.",
NAILSMITH_MEET_3,"After a Nailsmith are you? Well you've found one. I'm not much for talk, but if its a nail that needs repair then you've come to the right bug.<page>Your own nail is in quite a sorry state. It's obviously not one of mine. Still, anything can be refined with enough effort and skill, even that broken blade.",
NAILSMITH_OFFER_ORE,"I see you have some Pale Ore. A rare, fine metal, that. Give me the ore and some Geo for my efforts, and I'll reforge your nail to make it stronger.",
PAINTED,"I'm afraid I can't speak at length. If I move too much, Sheo's masterwork will be ruined and I'd hate to see him upset.<page>Though he may seem imposing, in truth he's a delicate sort.",
NAILSMITH_DREAM_CLIFF,My life's work achieved... What more is left...?,
NAILSMITH_MEET_2,Hmm?<page>Oh. I thought you were someone else.,
NAILSMITH_DREAM_INTERIOR,...To forge the perfect Nail...,

QUIRREL_GREENPATH_1,"Oh, hello there! Seems we both tread far from the path.<page>I can hardly believe those dusty old highways led to such a lush and lively place!<page>This building suggests some form of worship, though its idol has clearly been long forgotten. Doubles equally well for a moment's respite.",
QUIRREL_QUEENSTATION_02,"Can you imagine this place in its time? Hordes of bugs travelling about the Kingdom; stag bells ringing; the station bustling with activity and life.<page>Now only our like even know it exists.<page>That's a special thing I suppose, to cherish these sights, even in their decay.",
QUIRREL_GREENPATH_3,"Your nail looks a fine instrument, but it's showing signs of wear.<page>I'd wager up there it would take you far. Down here however, I suspect you'll soon meet dangers the surface world can't match.",
DREAM_EGGTEMPLE,What is this feeling?... So familiar. Drawn forward yet repelled.<page>And those shapes upon the door...To gaze directly at them turns my mind to fog.,
QUIRREL_TEACHER_2,"Do not hesitate. The choice to reform was hers, not mine.<page>She knows what you would do and seems to welcome it. ",
DREAM_QUEENSTATION,Even those great stags bowed to Hallownest's King. What devotion he must have inspired.,
QUIRREL_TEMPLE_2,Unused,
QUIRREL_TEMPLE_3,Unused,
QUIRREL_TEMPLE_1,For so long I've felt drawn here. So many tales full of wonders and horrors. No longer could I resist. I just had to see it for myself.<page>And what a time I chose to arrive! This dead world has sprung to life.<page>The creatures are riled up and the earth rumbles. The air is thick. I wonder what could have brought it all about?,
QUIRREL_MANTIS_01,"Hello again! I suppose you've already met with the tribe of this village, hmm? They seem a little distrustful of strangers... to put it lightly.<page>They're not brutes though, no. The sickness in the air that clouds the mind of lesser beasts... they resist it. They retain their intellect and their honour, though also their lethal traditions.<page>I've some words of advice, my friend. If you plan to challenge the lords of this tribe, your blunted nail may prove inadequate.<page>There is a city nearby, the old capital of Hallownest. I've heard a Nailsmith resides there. Seek the old bug out and you may find progress that much easier.",
QUIRREL_TEMPLE_5,Did you pass that town above? What a gloomy little place. And such majesty hidden right beneath!<page>I suppose that's why they've all headed down here. Who could resist such possibilities?,
QUIRREL_TEACHER_1A,"Did she call you too then? I realise it's no coincidence we arrive together. <page>Though much of my memory is blank, this place I recall.<page>Within these chambers the Teacher sought to store the Kingdom's knowledge and at its core, she stored herself.",
DREAM_SLUGSHRINE,That lake... a revered presence once slept deep within...<page>Did it? What would make me think such things?,
QUIRREL_GREENPATH_2,"I saw a strange fellow out there. He seemed quite taken by the lake.<page>I'd planned to offer greetings, though figured I'd first tend to my nail on chance our meeting goes poorly. ",
DREAM_SPA,This one too must seek the village at the nest's heart. What mystery the purpose that sees it share my path.,
DREAM_ARCHIVE_ENTRANCE,"...Who are you, that leads me to this place? ",
QUIRREL_MEET_TEMPLE,"Hello there! How delightful to meet another traveller on these forgotten roads.<page>You're a short one, but you've a strong look about you.",
QUIRREL_SPA,"Hello, hello! What a thrill this is, to find such warm comfort amidst the den of beasts.<page>This is a ferocious place no doubt. Supposedly, there's a village deep in the warren. Its inhabitants never accepted Hallownest's King.",
QUIRREL_QUEENSTATION_01,"Isn't this something. I'd not expected to discover so huge a Stag Station after that foggy descent.<page>The bugs of Hallownest must've been an impressive lot, building such grand structures so far into these wilds.<page>Seems the dangerous creatures about haven't yet made their way in here. It's the perfect place for a quick rest.",
QUIRREL_NODREAMNAIL,"Ahh, but her mind is still locked to you. That final, powerful protection stays in place.<page>If you would attempt to break her seal, you've first to discover the means to open a mind. Such tools may exist to perform the feat, though in my own travels I've not come across one.<page>I'd heard it told the Kingdom's moths did delve amongst dreams and the dead. Perhaps you'd seek them out?",
QUIRREL_GREENPATH_REPEAT,"Hallownest is perfect for vigilant explorers like us. So tense and thrilling. In this place, you're either alert or you're dead.",
QUIRREL_TEACHER_1C,"She called me here, now, to reverse that protection. All in aid of you.",
QUIRREL_TEACHER_1B,"To save Hallownest, the Teacher willingly became a seal, but upon herself she enacted an additional protection.<page>Though I cannot recall its happening, I played a part in that feat.",
QUIRREL_RUINS_4,Isn't this a wonderful spot for a rest? I so love the sound of the rain upon glass.,
QUIRREL_TEMPLE_6,Truly a marvel...,
QUIRREL_RUINS_1,"The capital lies before us my friend. What a sombre place it seems and one that holds the answers to many a mystery.<page>I too have felt the pull of this place, though now I sit before it I find myself hesitant to descend.<page>Is it fear I wonder, or something else that holds me back?   ",
QUIRREL_RUINS_2,"The city looks to be built into an enormous cavern, and the rain pours down from cracks in the stone above.<page>There must be a lot of water up there somewhere. I suppose, if the cave roof stayed strong this long, it should hold for us.<page>Before I leave this Kingdom, I'd like to see where all that water comes from. What a sight it must be!",
QUIRREL_RUINS_3,"If you look down from here, through the rain, you can just make out those twisted sentries, their husks still stuck in endless patrol.<page>I'd be cautious around them my short friend. Their training will not have been forgotten. This city presents some formidable foes.",
QUIRREL_FOGCANYON_B,I can feel it calling... Dare I head in? ,
QUIRREL_FOGCANYON_A,"Doesn't this kingdom just abound with surprises? A building atop an acid lake.<page>Despite the sight, I can't help but feel... familiarity? Something stirs in my mind, though I can't yet tell what..<page>I'd thought it my lust for discovery that led me here but now there seems something else.<page>This building beckons me.",
QUIRREL_TEMPLE_4,"To persevere in this ruin, that old nail alone just won't be enough. Though that's no problem! One only has to look around.<page>Plenty have come before us and most have met their grisly end, many more equipped than you and I.<page>I'm sure they wouldn't mind were a fellow explorer to relieve them of their tools. It's a kindness really. The dead shouldn't be burdened with such things.",
QUIRREL_MINES_4,So small it seems...,
QUIRREL_MANTIS_REPEAT,"My own route takes me towards that great city. If you search out the Nailsmith, it may not be long until our paths cross again.",
QUIRREL_MINES_1,"Ahh, quite a view, no?<page>I'm not surprised you survived the trek through these shimmering caverns.<page>There's an air of strength about you. I suspect it would be quite intimidating, if not for your small stature.",
QUIRREL_MINES_2,"Did it sadden you to see those miners below, still labouring at their endless task?<page>Even overcome, strong purpose has been imprinted upon their husks.<page>The crystal ore is said to contain a sort of energy, not as powerful as the soul the city dwellers harnessed but far less lethal.<page>...Strange to know such ancient facts. I wonder from where my knowledge comes?",
QUIRREL_MINES_3,"At this high vantage I can just make it out, the light from that sad little town.<page>I doubt its residents could even comprehend the scale of the world that surrounds them.",

QUIRREL_MEET_TEMPLE_C,"A great stone egg, lying in the corpse of an ancient kingdom. And this egg...Is it warm? It certainly gives off a unique air.<page>Can it be opened?

QUIRREL_EPILOGUE_A,"Again we meet, my short friend. Here at last, I feel at peace.<page>Twice I've seen this world and though my service may have stripped the first experience from me, I'm thankful I could witness its beauty again.<page>Hallownest is a vast and wondrous thing, but with as many wonders as it holds, I've seen none quite so intriguing as you.<page>Ha. My flattery returns only silent stoicism. I like that.<page>I like that very much.",
RELICDEALER_EGG_3,"A third Arcane Egg? You're an exceptional explorer to have found so many.<page>An egg is a perfect protective form. In Hallownest we use stone journals or tablets, our text engraved atop. These eggs are far more secure. Their records are stored within.<page>In fear of damaging the eggs, I'm only able to access the outer layer, but it's clear those in the distant past could somehow access information stored even deeper within.<page>If only I could find a way to do so. Just think of the discoveries to be made!",
RELICDEALER_DOOR,"Gone out to clear my head. Will be back soon. If you have something you absolutely must sell, come find me in Fountain Square.",
RELICDEALER_EGG_1,"An Arcane Egg, eh? Now this, this is an ancient thing. These relics are the prize of my profession. There's knowledge hidden within, though it's very difficult, painstaking work to extract.<page>One large understanding can be gleaned though. This civilisation may claim itself the first, but something else did exist within this place before Hallownest.<page>Each egg offers a narrow glimpse into that forgotten age.",
RELICDEALER_NO_RELICS,"Hm. Looks like you don't have any relics on you. If you manage to find any in good condition, bring them to me and I'll give you a fair amount of Geo for them.",
RELICDEALER_SEAL_5,"Yep, that's another Hallownest Seal alright.<page>The shop'll be overflowing with these things soon. Gah! I'd never guessed so many would still be lying around.<page>If they're as common as you make them seem, maybe I've been offering too much for them?",
RELICDEALER_JOURNAL_1,"A Wanderer's Journal, eh?<page>Though they're common finds about the kingdom, I much enjoy the deciphering of their text.<page>Read together they paint a morbid tale. It seems fate was unkind to most who travel within Hallownest's ruin.",
RELICDEALER_SEAL_7,"A Hallownest Seal?<page>You're a talented collector, alright. The best I've met. If you keep at it, I worry I'll run out of space in the shop!",
RELICDEALER_IDOL_2,"A King's Idol?<page>If you look closely, each of these idols is subtly different. There are fine engravings about them that take some time to decipher.<page>I suspect each was tailored to the owner. A personalised symbol of the king's omnipotence.",
RELICDEALER_FOUNTAIN_REPEAT,"I'll be getting back to the shop soon. If I stay out here too long I'll get washed into the Waterways.<page>Come and visit if you like. If you have relics, I mean. I'm not much for chatter.",
RELICDEALER_IDOL_5,"A King's Idol?<page>With as many of these as you've delivered, the other Relic Seekers are like to think I've gone mad for the King!<page>Pah! Who am I kidding. They'll only be jealous of my collection. Find me more!",
RELICDEALER_IDOL_4,"A King's Idol?<page>I've often wondered the true visage of the king. Depictions are of an imposing, gleaming figure and a fiercely horned crown.<page>I suspect there's much embellishment in the imagery though. A ruler seeking worship tends to hide their blemishes. It'd do no good to appear a common bug.",
RELICDEALER_JOURNAL_3,A Wanderer's Journal? Yes. Yes. I'll add it to the pile with the others.<page>I don't know when I'll get to decipher this one. It's long hard work translating the many languages of the bugs that explore these caverns.,
RELICDEALER_JOURNAL_2,Another Wanderer's Journal?<page>I might not offer a lot for each but they're plentiful about the caverns and I doubt you'll find another willing to make trade for Geo.,
RELICDEALER_JOURNAL_5,"Another Wanderer's Journal, eh?<page>This journal is of traditional stone type. Text endures well upon it.<page>In its declining age, this city switched from stone to parchment woven of spider's silk.<page>It's a small tragedy, but the moisture in these towers has rendered most of those texts illegible. ",
RELICDEALER_JOURNAL_4,A Wanderer's Journal?<page>You've a knack for finding these. Corpses must be frequent on your journey. No doubt your nail's created many more.,
RELICDEALER_JOURNAL_7,"What's that? A Wanderer's Journal?<page>I've so many of these now. Once I get around to deciphering them all, I'll be the preeminent scholar on Hallownest's dead.",
RELICDEALER_JOURNAL_6,"A Wanderer's Journal?<page>Have you heard that saying about stone journals?<page>If danger lurks close by and your nail has dulled with wear,<br>Just swing your journal at your foes with blunt and deadly flair.<page>S'a good one isn't it! And accurate. They sure have a heft to them.",
RELICDEALER_JOURNAL_8,A Wanderer's Journal?<page>It's quite incredible how many of these you've collected. You must have travelled the breadth of the kingdom to accrue such a haul.,
RELICDEALER_IDOL_1,"A King's Idol, eh?<page>Hallownest's king was an elusive figure, deified by the citizens. With the king rarely seen, worship was offered through these idols.<page>There's an expert craft to them. Few alive could match this skill.",
RELICDEALER_SEAL_1,"A Hallownest Seal, eh? Very interesting this.<page>Do you know of the Kingdom's five great knights? They're revered figures of Hallownest, often mentioned in the annals of the Kingdom, but only as a group.<page>Both their names and appearance seem to have been expunged from history.<page>So long has passed since their time. It'd be a grand achievement to discover their identities.",
RELICDEALER_IDOL_3,"Another King's Idol?<page>Have you visited the remnants of his palace? It's down below this city, in the bedrock of the kingdom.<page>Must've been an impressive sight in its time. Now there's nothing left.<page>It's a strange thing though. There are no signs of conflict around the area. It's as though the whole place just vanished. ",
RELICDEALER_DREAM_FOUNTAIN,...Who were you mystery knight?... Why no mention beyond your fountain?..,
RELICDEALER_SEAL_6,Another Hallownest Seal? Pass it over then.,
RELICDEALER_TALK,"There's a forgotten history hidden in this kingdom's antiques, though few seem willing to look. Others come just to claw away at the cracks and ruins.<page>Pah! Scavengers and thieves. It's contemptible.",
RELICDEALER_TALK_REPEAT,We've talked enough I think. Relics need cleaning. Texts need deciphering. Out with you! This isn't a museum.,
RELICDEALER_TALK_2,"Admiring my shop are you? Well I'm no squatter.<page>This place was dead empty when I moved in and there's no one left alive who'd lay claim to the tower.<page>If you fancy yourself a domicile in the city, go find somewhere else, preferably in another building.<page>I'm well content with just my relics. I'm not after neighbours.",
RELICDEALER_SEAL_4,"Another Hallownest Seal?<page>Others have told me there's a statue out by the city's entrance depicting a large knightly figure. Could be one of the Kingdom's great five.<page>I'd have looked it over myself, but the gate's long been shut tight and it's too much hassle taking the long way round with all those blasted husks about.",
RELICDEALER_FOUNTAIN,"Oh? What are you doing out in this miserable downpour?<page>Impressive fountain isn't it? I'm sure we'd be able to appreciate it more if we weren't both getting drenched.<page>That knight up there was an important one. The plaque here mentions its 'sacrifice,' which carries something of an ominous tone.<page>Probably met some sort of horrible end, though it sounds like the knight's goal may have been achieved in the process<page>In all the relics I've collected, I've yet to find a clue as to what that was.",
RELICDEALER_SEAL_2,"Another Hallownest Seal? Pass it over.<page>Ah. I enjoy collecting their like, but there's little information to be gleaned of each.<page>Mind you, they do keep a nice shine about them and there's nothing wrong with appreciating something purely on aesthetic merits.",
RELICDEALER_NAILSMITH,"That nail you bear looks mighty blunt. There're cracks all through it. It's as much a relic as the objects in my shop!<page>I've little interest in weapons myself, but it may be an idea to hunt down that old Nailsmith.<page>His hut's on the outskirts of the city. Not that far from here. He might help add some sting to your weapon, provided he's feeling generous.  ",
RELICDEALER_SEAL_3,"A Hallownest Seal, eh? Give it here.<page>Do you have anything else for me? If not, get your damp little self out of my home.",
RELICDEALER_DUNG,"Urgh! What do you think you're doing, coming into my nice little shop stinking like that?!<page>These relics have been through enough. They don't need you spreading your stench all over them! Crawl back to the Waterways or wherever you came from!",
RELICDEALER_DREAM,...This short one's got an odd look about it... though vaguely familiar?..,
RELICDEALER_SHOP_INTRO,"Aye Aye. Come searching for rare items have you? Well hands off! This collection is mine and I won't be selling to grubby little wanderers.<page>Still, I imagine you come across many interesting items in your travels. Maybe you'd care to part with some? I'll offer a fair trade for each.",
RELICDEALER_CONVO_1,"No touching the antiques! My stock is not for sale.<page>Still, if you've managed to come upon any interesting trinkets during your travels, I may be willing to trade. Step over to the counter here and I'll see what you've got.",
RELICDEALER_NO_RELICS_2,Not carrying any relics with you? Go find some for me. I'll pay good Geo for nice items.,
RELICDEALER_EGG_4,"A fourth Arcane Egg! I wouldn't have believed it possible. I've never met a bug with your knack for uncovering this Kingdom's treasures.<page>You must have some sort of sense about you? Or maybe these eggs are somehow drawn to you.<page>My fellows have claimed there's a will of sorts within each egg, that each seeks its own bearer, or reject them.<page>That'd be a subtle power indeed, and I remain sceptical. Relic Seekers are prone to confusing facts with fable.",
RELICDEALER_EGG_2,"Another Arcane Egg?<page>It's a rare chance to own two of these. I'll be the envy of all my colleagues, though my purse is feeling much lighter for it.<page>These eggs are the most desired find from time before Hallownest, but they're not the only remnant of that age.<page>You may have come upon them, those old statues that seem a store for soul? They too prove its existence, though in a larger, cruder form. ",
SHAMAN_QUAKE,"Ah ho! I'm sensing new power about you, one that'll crack the rock beneath us. A useful thing for one looking to travel ever deeper.<page>My third uncle used to possess similar abilities. He also possessed a ferocious temper! Ohohoho! What a dreadful combination. ",
SHAMAN_OPEN_GATE,"And look! The gate between us has opened. Ohoho!<page>I'm sure you're eager to move on. Farewell, and have faith! Whatever you are seeking... it will find you! Ohohoho!",
SHAMAN_OPENED_GATE,"Why do you hesitate? You'll get nothing more from me, I'm afraid.<page>Though I do admire your persistence! Ohohohoho! ",
SHAMAN_SUMMONED_1,"Don't be afraid. Have faith! That spell belongs to you now, all you need to do is take it!<page>Ohohoho, you won't be going much further without it, I promise you!",
SHAMAN_MEET,"Oho! Who is that creeping out of the darkness? My, you're looking grim! A strange, empty face and a wicked looking weapon!<page>Something important has drawn you down into Hallownest's corpse, but I won't ask what. Perhaps the reason you've found me is because you need my help?<page>Say no more, friend. I'm going to give you a gift, a nasty little spell of my own creation. It's just perfect for a little one like you! Ohoho!",
SHAMAN_DREAM,Poking around in the dreams of others... You're more curious than you look! Oho ho ho ho!,
SHAMAN_RETURN,"Oho! What brings you back through here, little shadow? Are you lost?<page>Don't worry about me. I don't need anything more from you. Ohohoho!",
SHAMAN_KILLED_BLOCKER_2,"Oho! There you are! I was watching over you while you slept, and must have slipped away myself. I woke up and found you'd disappeared! You are a surprising one, ohoho!<page>Actually, I wanted to ask a small favour of you. You see, there is a certain creature lurking just above us, in the heart of this temple...<page>...Oho? Well, yet another surprise! You've slain that creature before I've even asked!<page>I scarcely deserve such a friend as you! You're a marvel! Ohohoho!",
SHAMAN_KILLED_BLOCKER_1,"Oho! So it's done then, you've slain the beast!<page>The poor thing! It must have been terrified of you. It used to be quite docile, but the rancid air in these caverns filled it with some ancient rage.<page>Still, you did what had to be done! You have my gratitude! Of course, we both know you wouldn't have made it through without that spell of mine... Ohoho!",
SHAMAN_FUNG_DREAM,...Hear...me...,
SHAMAN_QUAKE2,"My friend. My friend. There's another quality about you yet. You didn't perchance visit my fourth aunt?<page>She makes her home beside that Crystal Mount. Leaves quite an impression on those that seek her out. Were I not bound here, I'd love to visit myself.",
SHAMAN_SCREAM2,"That scream? Ooohh, distorted in such a way... It's not within the skills of us snails to do such a thing.<page>Wherever you draw this new power from, it's not a place my kind ever thought to look.",
SHAMAN_CRYSTAL_DREAM,...Free...me...,
SHAMAN_SUMMONED_2,"Oho, you've come back! Didn't you like the look of my gift? You left without saying a word!<page>Perhaps you're braver than you think! Go ahead and take what belongs to you!",
SHAMAN_FIREBALL2,"What's this? My vengeful gift has warped within you. You've twisted it into something... else.<page>Ohohohoh! I knew it. My friend! You're a marvel. Your essence has melded with the spell.<page>You must have found a powerful source to transform it in such a unique, expressive way.",
SHAMAN_FUNG,A corpse overgrown with vegetation.,
SHAMAN_TRAPPED_1,"Oho? You've woken at last! I apologise, perhaps I should have warned you about the power of that spell. I was watching over you as you slept, but seem to have slipped away myself! Ohohoho!<page>Now we're awake, I was wondering whether you would do me a small favour. Not as repayment for my gift of course, simply because we're now friends.<page>You see, a horrid great beast has made its home in the heart of this temple. Such disrespect! I would be quite grateful if you were to venture deeper in and slay it for me.<page>It's a hardy creature, but with your new power you're more than a match for it! Good luck with this small favour, my friend! Ohohohohohoho!",
SHAMAN_TRAPPED_2,"What is it? Are you wondering about this gate between us? Ohoho! It's a curious thing, but this door will not open until you have slain that creature lying in the heart of the temple.<page>Don't worry about it. I'm sure the spirits of my ancestors will be watching over you.",
SHAMAN_SCREAM,"Pried a spell out've my larger cousin did you? Aren't you the charming one.<page>She's not usually the generous sort, certainly not as giving as myself, but she does have that wonderful voice! It's no surprise her spells take on such aural force. ",
SLY_GENERIC,"Pockets feeling empty? If you need some more Geo, take a trip into the ruins below us and hunt around. Just take care not to fall into a haze. I won't be coming down to rescue you.",
SLY_GENERIC_NM,"How are your travels, Nailmaster? As time goes by, I'm sure you'll only grow stronger.<page>If you see your fellow Nailmasters again, tell them I carry them in my thoughts always. And that they should come and buy something from their old teacher as a mark of respect.",
SLY_NAIL_HONED,"You've found a new nail, then? It looks like a much finer weapon than the last.<page>Hmm? Oh, this is the same nail... but it's been honed! By someone extremely skilled...<page>A nail is an extension of ourselves, it is the instrument by which we shape the world around us. It's a sacred duty to keep its edges sharp.<page>...Heh, sorry. I shouldn't ramble on like that. Let's talk Geo instead.",
SLY_MAPPER,I see they've opened that mapping shop across the way. I suppose a little competition is healthy.<page>Perhaps I should start to sell maps as well... or is that a little aggressive? Heh. All's fair in a world made of Geo.,
SLY_DREAM_STORE,...Wherever you are... Whatever it is you do now... I hope you three are looking after yourselves...,
SLY_BASEMENT_1,"...So, another would join our group.",
SLY_NOSTOCK_2,"Back again? You know I haven't any stock left, yes? You've cleaned me out.<page>Or were you hoping to sneak a peek at my mountain of Geo? Well it's mine now! And fairly traded. ",
SLY_RESCUE_REPEAT,"You're exploring then? Very brave! Plenty of courageous wanderers have been lost to the hunger of these old caverns.<page>You have your nail though, and I can tell just by looking that you know how to wield it.",
SLY_RESCUE_1,"...ugghh, Oro you oaf.... You wield your nail... like a club...<page>...Esmy... how much deeper do we have to go...",
SLY_NAILART,"Hmm, you seem a little different. Something has changed in your bearing.<page>Ah! The way you hold your nail! So you've learnt a Nail Art...<page>Very interesting. I wonder, do you have the passion to continue your training?",
SLY_DREAM_BASEMENT,...These refined weapons...The battles of Geo are much deadlier...,
SLY_SHOP_INTRO,"Ah, hello! I knew we'd meet again. How do you like my cosy little store? I've made myself pretty comfortable here, selling old trinkets to travellers like yourself.<page>If you're planning a trip below, I've several items that may improve your chance of survival.",
SLY_BASEMENT_2,"I have a gift for you, warrior. As a shopkeeper, I admit parting with it for free is rather difficult.<page>But as the Great Nailsage I must recognise your skill. You have mastered the arts of my remaining pupils. Now tradition decrees you too may hold the symbol.",
SLY_RESCUE_3,"I'm Sly. Usually, I live an uneventful life up in Dirtmouth. The air in these ruins doesn't agree with me, so I'd best be getting back.<page>If you return above, come and see me. I'm probably the friendliest face left there, and I can thank you properly for your good deed.",
SLY_RESCUE_2,"Oh! What?! Who are you?!<page>...I see. This old village. What a strange dream, to have led me down here! If you hadn't found me, I don't think I would've ever woken.",
SLY_DREAM_RUINS,...Geo. Geo. All the world is Geo. No nail can withstand its might...,
SLY_KEY_2,"What do you have there? Why, that's the key to my storeroom! I thought I'd lost it for good.<page>Hmm? Did you find it in those old mines perhaps? Very curious. I've no idea how it ended up in such a remote place.<page>Very honest of you to return it to me, yes. Very kind. And now that I can open my old storeroom up, I can sell you some of the rare stock that's been gathering dust in there.<page>These items may be a little time-worn, but they still retain their full market value. Very precious stuff! Take a look... ",

Very precious stuff! Take a look... ",
SLY_BASEMENT_REPEAT,Off you go Nailmaster. I've nothing more to give you...<page>Nothing for free at least. I'll be up briefly and eager take your Geo in trade for my precious wares.,
SLY_NOSTOCK_1,"Ah, still looking for something to buy? Is your Geo weighing you down? Unfortunately, you seem to have cleared out everything I'd be willing to part with. Nothing left at all!<page>I think there might be a few old trinkets down in my storeroom, but I lost the key a while ago.<page>So, no more business between us I'm afraid! For now at least. Get out of here and let me spend some quality time with all the Geo you've gifted me.",
SLY_BASEMENT_3,"Wear it proudly, Nailmaster. You shall be the last to receive its like.",
STAG_CROSSROADS,"It was a long time ago, but I remember when these highways and crossroads pulsed with life. These are the paths I first carried passengers through when I was young.<page>Those travellers are long gone, yet still I remain. Now it seems it's just you and I and the furtive creatures scratching and squirming all around us.",
STAG_ROYALGARDENS,"Before you rang the bell, I'd almost forgotten this station existed. It was not often used by the common bugs, being a well-guarded retreat for our late Queen.<page>Even as overgrown as they've become, these gardens are still beautiful after all this time. I'm sure the Queen would be happy to know that.",
STAG_DEEPNEST,"Ahh, little one... Where are we? I have never been to this station. It has a strange air of danger to it. Let me take you somewhere safer, quickly.",
STAG_DREAM,"I tire so easily now, and my old legs seem to ache more and more. Still, I'm lucky to grow old at all... so many others haven't.",
STAG_FLOWER_WARNING,"That flower you're carrying... It looks quite beautiful, but also very delicate. I fear if you travel with me it will be ruined.<page>If you need to keep it intact, I'd suggest using your own legs to carry it to its destination.",
STAG_TISO,"I see another takes rest upon the bench. There's something unpleasant about that one, but a stag station's doors are open to all.<page>If he requests passage, I'll offer it gladly. My duty as a stag far outweighs any personal distaste. ",
STAG_NEST,"Being back in my old home... I feel the weight of my long life bearing down on me.<page>I carry it proudly, though. Wherever I travel, the memories of my family and my kind come with me.",
STAG_TOWN,"This place... we are near the surface, I believe? There is a town here. You should take the opportunity to rest.<page>This place was once full of travellers coming and going. It seems much quieter now.",
STAG_TRAM,"That pass you hold! Is it not for that ghastly machine, the tram? I hope you're not thinking of riding on that grotesque contraption.<page>The thought a mere machine could attempt what we stags do! Foolish...Very foolish.",
STAG_HOPE_1,"What do you think of my old home, little one?<page>It was full of life, once. Stags coming and going, swapping stories of the places they'd been and the passengers they'd met.<page>For a long time now, I've considered myself the only one remaining. The last stag.<page>But being in the Nest again... there's something in the air. A smell, or a warmth, or a presence perhaps?<page>Could it be, other stags have made their way out into the wider world?",
STAG_REMEMBER_3,"Little one! I've found it! The Stag Nest, where I was born and raised.<page>I've yet to go there again. My duty binds me to travel only where I am called, but if you wished to see it yourself, I could take you there.<page>None may remain to welcome us, but the nest is still a sight to behold! Give me the word, and we will go there at once.",
STAG_REMEMBER_2,"Ahh, many stag stations have been opened. Again I can travel the breadth of the kingdom. So many grand thoroughfares and old sideways I'd forgotten.<page>Somewhere amongst the lines lies the Stag Nest, the place where I was born and raised. I'd thought its location lost to my failing mind, but now I can almost remember the path.<page>If you keep opening stag stations and beckoning me through them, perhaps I'll again find that Nest. Ahh, I would like that very much!",
STAG_HOPE_2,"Yes, I will hold onto that hope. My kin, still alive, still out there, journeying beyond these lands.<page>But for me, I could never abandon the stagways. Not as long as passengers still need them.<page>I can tell you still have important work to do. I will be your companion as long as my old body still serves.<page>Let us enjoy the old stagways of this kingdom together a little longer.",
STAG_RUINS2,"Little one, we stand in the King's Station! Named of course for the King of Hallownest, he who ordered the building of the stagways and stations.<page>The King never rode the stagways himself, but I've heard he was a glorious bug to behold, bright and radiant in visage, so much so it hurt to look at him.",
STAG_TRAVEL_1,"Ready to go, little one?",
STAG_END_SPEAK,"Eager to travel the stagways? Just hop upon that platform, give me the signal and we'll soon be on our way.",
STAG_HIDDEN,"Ah! What station is this, hidden all the way at the bottom of the world?<page>Until I heard the bell calling, I didn't even know the Stagways travelled so deep. You've discovered something quite astounding, little one!<page>No matter how old I grow, the world still keeps surprises like this stowed away...",
STAG_MEET,"Greetings, little one! It's been an age since I last heard the ringing of a station bell. It echoed down the stagways and called me to you.<page>I've grown stiff and tired over these many years and I've forgotten much, but the sound of the bell will always call me back.<page>These stagways stretch the depths of Hallownest. If you want to travel them, hail me from the platform. I will take you where you need to go.",
STAG_RESTINGGROUNDS,The Resting Grounds... Passengers would come here to conduct rituals for those who had passed on.<page>Not any more though. Perhaps the dead conduct their own rituals now?,
STAG_REMEMBER_1,"You've opened several stag stations now, haven't you? I'm thankful for the opportunity to once more travel through the kingdom.<page>As I visit more places I feel my memories returning to me, like the stagways of my mind are running once more.<page>Continue to open the stations and you'll have my deepest gratitude.",
STAG_EGG_INSPECT,An empty eggshell.,
STAG_FUNGUS,"Ahh, this gladdens me. The Queen's Station has opened once more. This place was a bustling hub of travel, well-placed for travellers visiting the outer edges of the land.<page>You're quite the explorer to find this place.",
STAG_RUINS1,I remember this station well. A common trip it was. Goods from all over the kingdom were transported here.<page>Not a lot was sent back the other way though.,
STAG_GREENPATH,"My, this place is much changed since I last saw it. The greenery grows so wild the station's like to be consumed by it.",
