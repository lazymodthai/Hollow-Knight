SHAMAN_QUAKE,"Ah ho! I'm sensing new power about you, one that'll crack the rock beneath us. A useful thing for one looking to travel ever deeper.<page>My third uncle used to possess similar abilities. He also possessed a ferocious temper! Ohohoho! What a dreadful combination. ",
SHAMAN_OPEN_GATE,"And look! The gate between us has opened. Ohoho!<page>I'm sure you're eager to move on. Farewell, and have faith! Whatever you are seeking... it will find you! Ohohoho!",
SHAMAN_OPENED_GATE,"Why do you hesitate? You'll get nothing more from me, I'm afraid.<page>Though I do admire your persistence! Ohohohoho! ",
SHAMAN_SUMMONED_1,"Don't be afraid. Have faith! That spell belongs to you now, all you need to do is take it!<page>Ohohoho, you won't be going much further without it, I promise you!",
SHAMAN_MEET,"Oho! Who is that creeping out of the darkness? My, you're looking grim! A strange, empty face and a wicked looking weapon!<page>Something important has drawn you down into Hallownest's corpse, but I won't ask what. Perhaps the reason you've found me is because you need my help?<page>Say no more, friend. I'm going to give you a gift, a nasty little spell of my own creation. It's just perfect for a little one like you! Ohoho!",
SHAMAN_DREAM,Poking around in the dreams of others... You're more curious than you look! Oho ho ho ho!,
SHAMAN_RETURN,"Oho! What brings you back through here, little shadow? Are you lost?<page>Don't worry about me. I don't need anything more from you. Ohohoho!",
SHAMAN_KILLED_BLOCKER_2,"Oho! There you are! I was watching over you while you slept, and must have slipped away myself. I woke up and found you'd disappeared! You are a surprising one, ohoho!<page>Actually, I wanted to ask a small favour of you. You see, there is a certain creature lurking just above us, in the heart of this temple...<page>...Oho? Well, yet another surprise! You've slain that creature before I've even asked!<page>I scarcely deserve such a friend as you! You're a marvel! Ohohoho!",
SHAMAN_KILLED_BLOCKER_1,"Oho! So it's done then, you've slain the beast!<page>The poor thing! It must have been terrified of you. It used to be quite docile, but the rancid air in these caverns filled it with some ancient rage.<page>Still, you did what had to be done! You have my gratitude! Of course, we both know you wouldn't have made it through without that spell of mine... Ohoho!",
SHAMAN_FUNG_DREAM,...Hear...me...,
SHAMAN_QUAKE2,"My friend. My friend. There's another quality about you yet. You didn't perchance visit my fourth aunt?<page>She makes her home beside that Crystal Mount. Leaves quite an impression on those that seek her out. Were I not bound here, I'd love to visit myself.",
SHAMAN_SCREAM2,"That scream? Ooohh, distorted in such a way... It's not within the skills of us snails to do such a thing.<page>Wherever you draw this new power from, it's not a place my kind ever thought to look.",
SHAMAN_CRYSTAL_DREAM,...Free...me...,
SHAMAN_SUMMONED_2,"Oho, you've come back! Didn't you like the look of my gift? You left without saying a word!<page>Perhaps you're braver than you think! Go ahead and take what belongs to you!",
SHAMAN_FIREBALL2,"What's this? My vengeful gift has warped within you. You've twisted it into something... else.<page>Ohohohoh! I knew it. My friend! You're a marvel. Your essence has melded with the spell.<page>You must have found a powerful source to transform it in such a unique, expressive way.",
SHAMAN_FUNG,A corpse overgrown with vegetation.,
SHAMAN_TRAPPED_1,"Oho? You've woken at last! I apologise, perhaps I should have warned you about the power of that spell. I was watching over you as you slept, but seem to have slipped away myself! Ohohoho!<page>Now we're awake, I was wondering whether you would do me a small favour. Not as repayment for my gift of course, simply because we're now friends.<page>You see, a horrid great beast has made its home in the heart of this temple. Such disrespect! I would be quite grateful if you were to venture deeper in and slay it for me.<page>It's a hardy creature, but with your new power you're more than a match for it! Good luck with this small favour, my friend! Ohohohohohoho!",
SHAMAN_TRAPPED_2,"What is it? Are you wondering about this gate between us? Ohoho! It's a curious thing, but this door will not open until you have slain that creature lying in the heart of the temple.<page>Don't worry about it. I'm sure the spirits of my ancestors will be watching over you.",
SHAMAN_SCREAM,"Pried a spell out've my larger cousin did you? Aren't you the charming one.<page>She's not usually the generous sort, certainly not as giving as myself, but she does have that wonderful voice! It's no surprise her spells take on such aural force. ",
