HORNET_ABYSS_REPEAT,"I'd urge you to take that harder path, but what end may come, the decision rests with you.",
HORNET_PRE_FINAL_BATTLE_REPEAT,"Ghost of Hallownest, you possess the strength to enact an end of your choosing. Would you supplant our birth-cursed sibling, or would you transcend it?",
HORNET_FINAL_BOSS,Do it! Make your choice. My thread will only hold so long.<page>Prolong our world's stasis or face the heart of its infection.,
HORNET_PRE_FINAL_BATTLE,"The path is opened. One way or another an end awaits inside.<page>I won't be joining you in this. That space is built to sustain your likes. Its bindings would drain me were I to join.<page>Don't be surprised. I'll not risk my own life in your attempt, though if the moment presents I'll aid as I'm able.",
HORNET_PRE_FINAL_BATTLE_DREAM,...Could it achieve that impossible thing? Should it?,
HORNET_GREENPATH,"Come no closer, ghost.<page>I've seen you, creeping through the undergrowth, stalking me.<page>This old kingdom... A terrible thing awakens. I can smell it in the air...<page>I know what you are. I know what you'd try to do. I can't allow it.",
HORNET_SPIDER_TOWN_REPEAT,"Leave me now, ghost. Allow me a moment alone before this bedchamber becomes forever a shrine.",
HORNET_OUTSKIRTS_1,So you'd pursue the deeper truth? It isn't one the weak could bear.,
HORNET_DOOR_UNOPENED,"I'm impressed little ghost. You've burdened yourself with the fate of this world, yet you still stand strong.<page>To break the Dreamer's seals would alone be considered an impossible task, but to accept that void inside yourself, that casts you as something rather exceptional.",
HORNET_SPIDER_TOWN_DREAM,...Mother... Forgive my inaction... but another path may be possible...,
HORNET_INSPECT_IK,"The remains of a wanderer, long deceased.",
HORNET_OUTSKIRTS_2,Prove yourself ready to face it. I'll not hold back. My needle is lethal and I'd feel no sadness in a weakling's demise.<page>Show me you can accept this Kingdom's past and claim responsibility for its future. ,
HORNET_FOUNTAIN_1,"Again we meet little ghost.<page>I'm normally quite perceptive. You I underestimated, though I've since guessed the truth.<page>You've seen beyond this kingdom's bounds. Yours is resilience born of two voids.<page>It's no surprise then you've managed to reach the heart of this world. In so doing, you shall know the sacrifice that keeps it standing.",
HORNET_FOUNTAIN_2,"If, knowing that truth, you'd still attempt a role in Hallownest's perpetuation, seek the Grave in Ash and the mark it would grant to one like you.",
HORNET_ABYSS_DREAM,"...It faced the void, and ascends unscathed... Could it unite such vast darkness?..",
HORNET_ABYSS_ASCENT_01,"Ghost. I see you've faced the place of your birth, and now drape yourself in the substance of its shadow.<page>Though our strength is born of similar source, that part of you, that crucial emptiness, I do not share.<page>Funny then, that such darkness gives me hope. Within it, I see the chance of change.<page>A difficult journey you would face, but a choice it can create. Prolong our world's stasis or face the heart of its infection. ",
HORNET_SPIDER_TOWN_01,"So you've slain the Beast... and you head towards that fated goal.<page>I'd not have obstructed this happening, but it caused me some pain to knowingly stand idle.<page>...What? You might think me stern but I'm not completely cold.<page>We do not choose our mothers, or the circumstance into which we are born. Despite all the ills of this world, I'm thankful for the life she granted me.<page>It's quite a debt I owed. Only in allowing her to pass, and taking the burden of the future in her stead, can I begin to repay it.",
HORNET_OUTSKIRTS_DEFEAT,"...So strong...<page>You could do it, if you had the will.<page>But could you raise your nail once knowing its tragic conception? And knowing yourself?...<page>Then do it, Ghost of Hallownest! Head onward. Burn that mark upon your shell and claim yourself as King.",
