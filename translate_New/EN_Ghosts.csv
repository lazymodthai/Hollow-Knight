HU_INSPECT,We remember the Elder.,
CHAGAX_TALK,I used to help others. They were brought to me sick and dying... What difference did it make?...<page>Any victory against death will always be temporary.,
HU_DEFEAT,"My mind... it clears. Have we been... sleeping, child?<page>Aah... I remember. Those proud lords... were they truly monsters? I remember their eyes now... bright and clear. Why then did I fear them so?<page>If there was madness in that village, it was I who brought it. They were right to cast me out.<page>When I attacked, they were right to...<page>They were right to kill...<page>To kill... me...?<page>...aah.",
MOLTEN_TALK,Don't fear my rotting form. Though my body sheds and changes my core remains the same.,
KCIN_REPEAT,Seeking power is a hollow goal. Best to search for other things.,
HEX_REPEAT,Go bother someone else. You're not the one I'm waiting for.,
XERO_REPEAT,"Do you still hope, wanderer? Will you flee? Or will you raise your weapon and doom us both?",
GROHAC_TALK,"We're always left with reminders of the errors we've made. Let your mistakes not burden you, but serve as guideposts on where not to travel.",
GALIEN_REPEAT,So then... shall we do battle? Let us test our strength in joyful combat!,
KARINA_TALK,"Are you admiring my fabulous markings? I'm of a distinguished species you see, though I've not seen another like me for the longest time.",
THISTLEWIND_TALK,"Ahhh, a wanderer.<page>I've been many places and done a great many things, but I suspect you will outdo me by far.<page>I've long ceased travelling the caverns of Hallownest and I suspect they're now far more dangerous than in my journeys, though with your capable air I'm sure you'll do fine.<page>Good luck! It's a vast world out there.",
WAYNER_TALK,"Hark, fellow adventurer! Are you heading out into the world? I'd join you, but it's been so long, I fear I'd lose my head.",
ALADAR_INSPECT,"Here lies Gorb, the Great Mind.",
MUMCAT_TALK,"Oh! The Queen! The Queen is coming! I've been waiting so long, and now she's almost here! I feel like I'm about to burst!<page>I've kept it safe, this sacred garden! I've kept it safe for all this time, and soon the Queen will return and teach me to fly!<page>Shall we wait together, stranger? Shall we play together?",
PERPETOS_TALK,"Are you enjoying your time in our glade? I'd offer advice, though to have made it here you're obviously quite adept at navigating our world and its perils.",
GARRO_REPEAT,Stand strong little warrior.,
GRASSHOPPER_TALK,"Isn't this just the most intriguing place? So many discoveries waiting to be made. We're about to set off ourselves, though we can't seem to agree on which way to head.<page>It's led to something of an argument between us. We should really stop squabbling about such petty things. ",
100NAIL_TALK,"Do you like my nails little wanderer? I carry only three, far less than legends may suggest.<page>Still! Each is sharper than the last and I'd require only one to cut you down. ",
MILLY_REPEAT,Buy my cookies! Once I've sold them all I can go home.,
MAGNUS_TALK,"All of life's problems can be solved with crushing force. Such a simple mantra and one I've always lived by.<page>If you weren't so scrawny, I'd suggest you follow my example.",
ATRA_REPEAT,My appearance should not cause you worry. Here I am truly at peace.,
GALIEN_DEFEAT,"Unbelievable... I am defeated at last! So this is what it feels like to be bested...<page>Still though, I am strong, am I not? When you see our King, surely you'll tell him of my valour...?<page>Yes... he sent you here to test me, didn't he? I knew he had not forgotten brave Galien.<page>I am ready... to join you now. Brothers, you and I. Let us leave this place...<page>...together...",
GALIEN_INSPECT,The body of a fallen warrior.,
NOEYES_REPEAT,"Precious children, a monster has come for us in the dark...Will you sing for me?",
HU_REPEAT,"Beware dreams of glory, child. Turn back, and do not return.",
PERPETOS_REPEAT,"You're very impressive for such a small thing. I'm something of a warrior myself, though even I'd hesitate to raise my nail against you.",
GRAVEDIGGER_REPEAT,Do as you will little wanderer. Cut a path toward your goal.<page>I shouldn't complain. It's your kind that keeps folks like me in business.,
MARKOTH_TALK,"You have come a long way, just to die here at the edge of the world.<page>No, do not speak. I have heard thousands and thousands of empty words from those like you. Your pride, your desires, your desperation... you will take these things with you once I strike you down.<page>Raise your weapon then, and die like those who came before you.",
MARISSA_REPEAT,"Even if only you, it's a wonderful thing to have an audience again.",
NOEYES_INSPECT,A face carved from stone.,
HIVEQUEEN_TALK,"Small thing. I know your kind.<page>If you attempt to resolve your past then know I am not the queen you seek.<page>It is the pale beings that bear blame for your nature.<page>Though this hive exists within Hallownest, we play no part in its attempt at perpetuation.",
XERO_DEFEAT,Ah... I can see now. Those who turn against the King are doomed as soon as they raise their weapon.<page>Do not call me a traitor. Simply call me a fool.<page>I know you will not flee. Wherever you go... I will be watching.,
MUMCAT_DEFEAT,"Oh, stranger... you're strong. Much stronger than me...<page>I've been waiting a long time, stranger. I've been fighting a long time, stranger.<page>I'm very, very tired! The Queen will be here soon, and I just need to sleep a little.<page>Wake me when the Queen arrives, stranger. Perhaps the Queen will teach us both to fly, stranger!<page>That... would be fun... wouldn't it...?",
BOSS_TALK,"I came from far away to reach this place. Though my shell may seem foreign, beneath it I am a bug the same as you.",
MAGNUS_REPEAT,"Remember tiny bug, crush your fears; crush your problems; crush your foes.",
REVEK_TALK,"The bugs within this glade are under my watch. Treat them with respect and you may remain, but raise your nail and you'll contend with me.",
ATRA_TALK,Don't fear little creature. Though a violent rage once possessed me the peaceful air in this place seems to keep it at bay. ,
MUMCAT_REPEAT,"Shall we wait together, stranger? Shall we play together?",
XERO_TALK,"Stop there! Those who try to leave this kingdom are cursed. Better to rest here, until time itself sleeps.<page>Hope and freedom. I thought that strength alone could grant me these things. In my dreams I would cut that plague with my nails, and then I turned my weapons upon the King.<page>When I awoke in this sacred place, I began to understand. Those who hope are already doomed.<page>Do you still hope, wanderer? Will you flee? Or will you raise your weapon and doom us both?",
WYATT_TALK,"Watch out!<page>I've an acidic touch and I wouldn't want you getting burned. It's a protection system of my kind, though something of a nuisance when it comes to meeting others.",
HIVEQUEEN_EXTRA,My Knight... At last you are freed.,
MAGE_LORD,"In my dreams I could see it. The Kingdom's salvation, the cure for the plague... the answer was in the soul that animates our bodies.<page>But the King... why?! He opposed everything I did...<page>His jealousy... his madness... by standing against me he robbed me of my immortality!<page>Now the King and his Kingdom are dead... but I... will live forever.",
MARKOTH_INSPECT,"The body of a warrior, with a shield and nails.",
HIVEQUEEN_REPEAT,To rail against nature is folly. All things must accept an end. ,
REVEK_TALK_DEFEAT_REPEAT,"To protect? Was that my task? If so, who was I protecting? It's only you and me here. ",
MARISSA_TALK,"Welcome to my stage little one. I am Marissa, a songstress of some renown, though given the sorry state of this place, you may find it hard to believe. <page>Huge crowds once flocked to hear me sing, then something changed. The audience, once so enrapt, began to leave. I continued to sing yet my voice fell silent upon their ears.<page>Perhaps you'd care to listen to me sing? You'll be the first in an age to hear it.",
GRASSHOPPER_REPEAT,"Left or right? Which way is best? It should be a simple thing, yet we're always at odds.  ",
XERO_INSPECT,Cursed are those who turn against the King.,
WALDIE_REPEAT,You wouldn't have the guts to face me anyway.,
GROHAC_REPEAT,"These husks around my neck? They're my precious friends, always there to keep me company and much better for conversation than the rest of the odd lot around here.",
MOLTEN_REPEAT,Though my body sheds and changes my core remains the same.,
CHAGAX_REPEAT,Any victory against death will always be temporary.... What a gloomy thought.,
MARKOTH_REPEAT,"Raise your weapon then, fool, and die like those who came before you.",
NOEYES_TALK,"My child... can you still see? Please, don't hurt me.<page>Can't sleep... with your eyes open, little one. Can't dream... if you're still breathing, little one.<page>Precious children... you speak such loathsome things as you sleep... your claws scratch and scrape...<page>Precious children, a monster has come for us in the dark...Will you sing for me?",
JONI_TALK,"Ahhh, I see you bear my blessing. I can't remember giving it, but my memory has been a little lacking of late.",
ALADAR_DEFEAT,I... am Gorb!<page>The great mind... the pain! Ascend! Ascend!<page>I... I am...,
GRAVEDIGGER_TALK,Ehh... Another wielding a weapon. I suppose you'll be leaving many a corpse in your wake?<page> If you won't spare thought for the dead at least consider all the extra work you force upon those in my profession.  ,
MILLY_TALK,Buy my cookies! They're ever so tasty.,
NOEYES_DEFEAT,"One by one... their eyes closed at last. I felt it... a warm stillness falling over us.<page>I'm sorry I was frightened of you. You were always protecting us, even when we couldn't see you.<page>Take us there, please. A place where light can not haunt us, a place without dreams...Please...",
100NAIL_REPEAT,Aren't my nails the most wonderful things? Their gleaming blades so sharp and deadly. ,
THISTLEWIND_REPEAT,"You find it strange to see a moth wielding a weapon? We are a passive species, though I am not the only one amongst us to take up arms.<page>Another braved the edges of this world, hoping to uncover a truth long forgotten.<page>I wonder what became of him?",
MUMCAT_INSPECT,"Protector of root and leaf, we honour you.",
KARINA_REPEAT,"You don't seem to bear the markings of rank, though you bear no markings of a lower form.<page>What are you? Do tell me. Are you a higher being or just another lowly grub? ",
CASPIAN_TALK,"Beware your own mind little one. Twisted minds breed dark deeds and mine was more twisted than most.<page>I thought it would be my end, but instead I found this glade and with it a sort of peace.",
WAYNER_REPEAT,"I'm envious of you, facing this world without fear. I could stand to learn from your approach.",
GALIEN_TALK,"Hoh, a fellow warrior, out here? I thought I was the only one brave enough and strong enough to survive in this foul, forgotten pit.<page>I am Galien, the strongest warrior in Hallownest! I came to this monstrous place to test my strength. No doubt you wish to test your might as well, hmm?<page>Yes, you and I are a rare breed, quite unlike this poor fellow who has fallen before us. The world is not kind to the weak, I fear.<page>So then... shall we do battle? Let us test our strength in joyful combat!",
POGGY_REPEAT,I've been waiting an awfully long while. Surely it's dinner time soon?,
REVEK_TALK_DEFEAT,"The glade has stilled. It's so quiet, yet I feel... failure? In this place, I once performed a task, but what was it?..  It's so hard to recall. Surely it was important? How could I forget such a thing?",
POGGY_TALK,"Skroink! You look pretty skinny. Very scrawny. That's the way to be I reckon.<page>Just look at me! A great big, juicy, fatty, oily... scrumptious bug. No wonder I'm so popular around here.",
ALADAR_TALK,I am Gorb!<page>Bow! Bow bow bow bow to Gorb!<page>The great mind! I am Gorb!<page>Ascend! Ascend! Ascend ascend ascend with Gorb!,
REVEK_REPEAT,"I assure you wanderer, my nail is sharp and I'll not hold back.",
ALADAR_REPEAT,Ascend! Ascend! Ascend ascend ascend with Gorb!,
JONI_REPEAT,Isn't it just so peaceful here? Such a perfect place to rest.,
HEX_TALK,"""I'll see you soon,"" she said, though that was long ago. I wonder where she went?",
HU_TALK,"Wait, child! Why have you come here? Have you come to tame this savage, ruined land?<page>Many have come to purify this place, but all who dwell here are eventually consumed.<page>Yes, even the wild bugs lurking below us. They were once proud like you, but now they are only monsters.<page>Beware dreams of glory, child. Turn back, and do not return.",
GARRO_TALK,"Are you a warrior, little one? A true warrior is one who can stand strong in the midst of a storm.",
MARKOTH_DEFEAT,"Never... have I been defeated in combat.<page>I can... see myself there, still sleeping. How long have I been hidden here?<page>Here at the edge of the world, no-one could find me... except you.<page>Warriors, knights, kings, even time itself... they have no power over me. Only you.<page>You are the darkness... come to consume me.",
KCIN_TALK,I was once obsessed with power though my time within this glade has shed me of such desire.<page>What folly it was to ever crave such a vicious thing. ,
FALSE_KNIGHT,"I wanted it.... the strength to protect the others...<page>When I saw that Knight... sleeping... safe in his big armoured shell...<page>It wasn't madness that drove me to it... I just wanted it...<page>But... in the end? If strength cannot save you, then what can...?",
WALDIE_TALK,"Don't judge me by appearance. Though my stature is small, I bear a dark soul and a tendency to go berserk in battle.",
WYATT_REPEAT,Don't get too close. I'd not wish to cause any harm.,
CASPIAN_REPEAT,"Do you think dark thoughts little one? When hidden behind a visage as impassive as your own, I find it hard to tell.",
BOSS_REPEAT,"You too are a warrior? I see your nail, but your shell seems underdeveloped. In your current state, to travel a land as dangerous as this seems unwise.",
