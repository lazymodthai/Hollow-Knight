RELICDEALER_EGG_3,"A third Arcane Egg? You're an exceptional explorer to have found so many.<page>An egg is a perfect protective form. In Hallownest we use stone journals or tablets, our text engraved atop. These eggs are far more secure. Their records are stored within.<page>In fear of damaging the eggs, I'm only able to access the outer layer, but it's clear those in the distant past could somehow access information stored even deeper within.<page>If only I could find a way to do so. Just think of the discoveries to be made!",
RELICDEALER_DOOR,"Gone out to clear my head. Will be back soon. If you have something you absolutely must sell, come find me in Fountain Square.",
RELICDEALER_EGG_1,"An Arcane Egg, eh? Now this, this is an ancient thing. These relics are the prize of my profession. There's knowledge hidden within, though it's very difficult, painstaking work to extract.<page>One large understanding can be gleaned though. This civilisation may claim itself the first, but something else did exist within this place before Hallownest.<page>Each egg offers a narrow glimpse into that forgotten age.",
RELICDEALER_NO_RELICS,"Hm. Looks like you don't have any relics on you. If you manage to find any in good condition, bring them to me and I'll give you a fair amount of Geo for them.",
RELICDEALER_SEAL_5,"Yep, that's another Hallownest Seal alright.<page>The shop'll be overflowing with these things soon. Gah! I'd never guessed so many would still be lying around.<page>If they're as common as you make them seem, maybe I've been offering too much for them?",
RELICDEALER_JOURNAL_1,"A Wanderer's Journal, eh?<page>Though they're common finds about the kingdom, I much enjoy the deciphering of their text.<page>Read together they paint a morbid tale. It seems fate was unkind to most who travel within Hallownest's ruin.",
RELICDEALER_SEAL_7,"A Hallownest Seal?<page>You're a talented collector, alright. The best I've met. If you keep at it, I worry I'll run out of space in the shop!",
RELICDEALER_IDOL_2,"A King's Idol?<page>If you look closely, each of these idols is subtly different. There are fine engravings about them that take some time to decipher.<page>I suspect each was tailored to the owner. A personalised symbol of the king's omnipotence.",
RELICDEALER_FOUNTAIN_REPEAT,"I'll be getting back to the shop soon. If I stay out here too long I'll get washed into the Waterways.<page>Come and visit if you like. If you have relics, I mean. I'm not much for chatter.",
RELICDEALER_IDOL_5,"A King's Idol?<page>With as many of these as you've delivered, the other Relic Seekers are like to think I've gone mad for the King!<page>Pah! Who am I kidding. They'll only be jealous of my collection. Find me more!",
RELICDEALER_IDOL_4,"A King's Idol?<page>I've often wondered the true visage of the king. Depictions are of an imposing, gleaming figure and a fiercely horned crown.<page>I suspect there's much embellishment in the imagery though. A ruler seeking worship tends to hide their blemishes. It'd do no good to appear a common bug.",
RELICDEALER_JOURNAL_3,A Wanderer's Journal? Yes. Yes. I'll add it to the pile with the others.<page>I don't know when I'll get to decipher this one. It's long hard work translating the many languages of the bugs that explore these caverns.,
RELICDEALER_JOURNAL_2,Another Wanderer's Journal?<page>I might not offer a lot for each but they're plentiful about the caverns and I doubt you'll find another willing to make trade for Geo.,
RELICDEALER_JOURNAL_5,"Another Wanderer's Journal, eh?<page>This journal is of traditional stone type. Text endures well upon it.<page>In its declining age, this city switched from stone to parchment woven of spider's silk.<page>It's a small tragedy, but the moisture in these towers has rendered most of those texts illegible. ",
RELICDEALER_JOURNAL_4,A Wanderer's Journal?<page>You've a knack for finding these. Corpses must be frequent on your journey. No doubt your nail's created many more.,
RELICDEALER_JOURNAL_7,"What's that? A Wanderer's Journal?<page>I've so many of these now. Once I get around to deciphering them all, I'll be the preeminent scholar on Hallownest's dead.",
RELICDEALER_JOURNAL_6,"A Wanderer's Journal?<page>Have you heard that saying about stone journals?<page>If danger lurks close by and your nail has dulled with wear,<br>Just swing your journal at your foes with blunt and deadly flair.<page>S'a good one isn't it! And accurate. They sure have a heft to them.",
RELICDEALER_JOURNAL_8,A Wanderer's Journal?<page>It's quite incredible how many of these you've collected. You must have travelled the breadth of the kingdom to accrue such a haul.,
RELICDEALER_IDOL_1,"A King's Idol, eh?<page>Hallownest's king was an elusive figure, deified by the citizens. With the king rarely seen, worship was offered through these idols.<page>There's an expert craft to them. Few alive could match this skill.",
RELICDEALER_SEAL_1,"A Hallownest Seal, eh? Very interesting this.<page>Do you know of the Kingdom's five great knights? They're revered figures of Hallownest, often mentioned in the annals of the Kingdom, but only as a group.<page>Both their names and appearance seem to have been expunged from history.<page>So long has passed since their time. It'd be a grand achievement to discover their identities.",
RELICDEALER_IDOL_3,"Another King's Idol?<page>Have you visited the remnants of his palace? It's down below this city, in the bedrock of the kingdom.<page>Must've been an impressive sight in its time. Now there's nothing left.<page>It's a strange thing though. There are no signs of conflict around the area. It's as though the whole place just vanished. ",
RELICDEALER_DREAM_FOUNTAIN,...Who were you mystery knight?... Why no mention beyond your fountain?..,
RELICDEALER_SEAL_6,Another Hallownest Seal? Pass it over then.,
RELICDEALER_TALK,"There's a forgotten history hidden in this kingdom's antiques, though few seem willing to look. Others come just to claw away at the cracks and ruins.<page>Pah! Scavengers and thieves. It's contemptible.",
RELICDEALER_TALK_REPEAT,We've talked enough I think. Relics need cleaning. Texts need deciphering. Out with you! This isn't a museum.,
RELICDEALER_TALK_2,"Admiring my shop are you? Well I'm no squatter.<page>This place was dead empty when I moved in and there's no one left alive who'd lay claim to the tower.<page>If you fancy yourself a domicile in the city, go find somewhere else, preferably in another building.<page>I'm well content with just my relics. I'm not after neighbours.",
RELICDEALER_SEAL_4,"Another Hallownest Seal?<page>Others have told me there's a statue out by the city's entrance depicting a large knightly figure. Could be one of the Kingdom's great five.<page>I'd have looked it over myself, but the gate's long been shut tight and it's too much hassle taking the long way round with all those blasted husks about.",
RELICDEALER_FOUNTAIN,"Oh? What are you doing out in this miserable downpour?<page>Impressive fountain isn't it? I'm sure we'd be able to appreciate it more if we weren't both getting drenched.<page>That knight up there was an important one. The plaque here mentions its 'sacrifice,' which carries something of an ominous tone.<page>Probably met some sort of horrible end, though it sounds like the knight's goal may have been achieved in the process<page>In all the relics I've collected, I've yet to find a clue as to what that was.",
RELICDEALER_SEAL_2,"Another Hallownest Seal? Pass it over.<page>Ah. I enjoy collecting their like, but there's little information to be gleaned of each.<page>Mind you, they do keep a nice shine about them and there's nothing wrong with appreciating something purely on aesthetic merits.",
RELICDEALER_NAILSMITH,"That nail you bear looks mighty blunt. There're cracks all through it. It's as much a relic as the objects in my shop!<page>I've little interest in weapons myself, but it may be an idea to hunt down that old Nailsmith.<page>His hut's on the outskirts of the city. Not that far from here. He might help add some sting to your weapon, provided he's feeling generous.  ",
RELICDEALER_SEAL_3,"A Hallownest Seal, eh? Give it here.<page>Do you have anything else for me? If not, get your damp little self out of my home.",
RELICDEALER_DUNG,"Urgh! What do you think you're doing, coming into my nice little shop stinking like that?!<page>These relics have been through enough. They don't need you spreading your stench all over them! Crawl back to the Waterways or wherever you came from!",
RELICDEALER_DREAM,...This short one's got an odd look about it... though vaguely familiar?..,
RELICDEALER_SHOP_INTRO,"Aye Aye. Come searching for rare items have you? Well hands off! This collection is mine and I won't be selling to grubby little wanderers.<page>Still, I imagine you come across many interesting items in your travels. Maybe you'd care to part with some? I'll offer a fair trade for each.",
RELICDEALER_CONVO_1,"No touching the antiques! My stock is not for sale.<page>Still, if you've managed to come upon any interesting trinkets during your travels, I may be willing to trade. Step over to the counter here and I'll see what you've got.",
RELICDEALER_NO_RELICS_2,Not carrying any relics with you? Go find some for me. I'll pay good Geo for nice items.,
RELICDEALER_EGG_4,"A fourth Arcane Egg! I wouldn't have believed it possible. I've never met a bug with your knack for uncovering this Kingdom's treasures.<page>You must have some sort of sense about you? Or maybe these eggs are somehow drawn to you.<page>My fellows have claimed there's a will of sorts within each egg, that each seeks its own bearer, or reject them.<page>That'd be a subtle power indeed, and I remain sceptical. Relic Seekers are prone to confusing facts with fable.",
RELICDEALER_EGG_2,"Another Arcane Egg?<page>It's a rare chance to own two of these. I'll be the envy of all my colleagues, though my purse is feeling much lighter for it.<page>These eggs are the most desired find from time before Hallownest, but they're not the only remnant of that age.<page>You may have come upon them, those old statues that seem a store for soul? They too prove its existence, though in a larger, cruder form. ",
