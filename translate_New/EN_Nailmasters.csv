SHEO_REPEAT_MODEL,"Building these models takes patience and a light touch. It's worth it though, seeing the grand old Knights of Hallownest come to life before our eyes.<page>Mighty Hegemol was always my favourite. What a towering figure he was, though surprisingly soft spoken for one so large.<page>They were all impressive in their own right, of course. Fierce Dryya, kindly Isma, mysterious Ze'mer... erm, and the other one.",
SHEO_SLY,"That charm! Only the Great Nailsage could have given that to you...<page>Seeing how strong you've become... it almost makes me want to take up my nail once more.<page>But no, I should stay on my current path and keep working at my art. If the Great Nailsage ever comes by, I want to show him how far I've come.",
ORO_GREET,"You've returned, though you were not invited. <page>As my pupil, it is lawful that I allow you rest and shelter, but do not stay longer than you need to.",
ORO_REFUSE,"""Those who do not share their strength will never learn."" My master used to say that.<page>Substitute ""Geo"" for ""strength"" and you'll have my own views on the matter. Begone!",
MATO_SLY,"That charm...! Could it be?! Only the Great Nailsage himself could have bestowed such a thing!<page>Your achievements humble my own, my pupil. I myself have sworn never to lay eyes on the Nailsage again. Not until I have truly mastered his teachings.<page>But if you see him again, please... let him know that I am forever grateful.",
SHEO_GREET,"So, your travels have brought you back. What have you learnt? How have you grown?<page>Myself? I am still trying to capture something with my brush... although I'm not quite sure what that thing is.",
SHEO_REPEAT,"I have spare brushes and plenty of paint. Once you tire of the nail, feel free to join me in my art.",
MATO_REFUSE,"My pupil, why do you hesitate? Do you think yourself unworthy of my Nail Art?<page>Do not fret. I too was once like you, unsure of my own strength. Stay here with me and meditate, and once you are ready we can begin the lesson.",
ORO_REPEAT,"Rest here if you must, but do not stay longer than you need to.",
MATO_REPEAT,"Before you leave, rest and meditate with me for a while. Your company is always welcome.",
ORO_BOW,"I have taught you all I can. Go back into the world, traveller. Leave me to my solitude.",
ORO_TAUGHT,"Hmph. I must say, you are an excellent pupil.<page>Your skill with the nail, and your thirst to become stronger... you remind me of my brothers.<page>I have taught you all I can. Go back into the world, traveller, and leave me to my solitude.",
ORO_DREAM,"Brother Mato, in your lonely home at the top of the world... do you still think of me as an enemy?<page>In the future, if you will listen... I will tell you why I chose to tread this path.",
SHEO_MATO,"That Nail Art you've learnt, the Cyclone Slash. That was always Mato's favourite.<page>It must have made him ecstatic to have a pupil like you. He always wanted to pass down what he'd learnt to a new generation.<page>He was not the most skilled pupil himself, but his enthusiasm and his kindness set him apart. I'm glad he achieved what he desired for so long. To be a teacher...",
ORO_SHEO,"I see you've been taught a Nail Art by my brother Sheo. How fortunate of you.<page>Yes, he was the mightiest of the Great Nailsage's pupils, far outshining Mato and myself. My brother and my master loved him very much.<page>He was always aloof, but... not unkind. When we last spoke, he said he was going to teach himself something completely new. I wonder if he achieved that goal.",
MATO_ART,"Ah, I can see it in your eyes - you're ready to learn my Nail Art! Shall we begin the lesson immediately?",
MATO_SHEO,"Ah! So my brother Sheo has taught you his Nail Art, the Great Slash! How lucky you are to have trained with him!<page>Sheo and I were very close when we trained together under the Great Nailsage. He often spoke of becoming tired of the Nail Arts and wanting to try something new.<page>I'm glad to see he changed his mind and continues to bear the proud title of Nailmaster along with me!",
MATO_BOW,"You honour me beyond words, my pupil...<page>Thank you.",
MATO_GREET,"My pupil, you have come to visit your old master! This is an honour I scarcely deserve.<page>Please, sit. You are always welcome to meditate here with me.",
MATO_DREAM,"My brother, Sheo... how fare you in that green kingdom of thorns you call home? I think of you every time I raise my nail...<page>Do you ever close your eyes and remember the time we spent together with Oro and our master? I like to think you do...",
MATO_ORO,"That Nail Art, the Dash Slash... learnt from my brother Oro, was it not?<page>So he is still alive then. Hm. I still haven't forgotten what he owes me and I never will.<page>Oh, I'm sorry. I shouldn't bother you with such things. I'm happy that you were able to train under another Nailmaster and grow stronger, my pupil.",
SHEO_NAILSMITH,"Oh, look who's joined us! We have quite a merry crowd now, don't we?<page>This fellow came wandering in to my hut, quite distraught and on his own quest for a new calling in life.<page>We talked, and found a common love of creating and building and honing a craft. So now we make art together!<page>It's good to have company, I hadn't realised how lonely I was. It's like being with my brothers again! Stay with us, if you like!",
ORO_ART,"So what will it be, traveller? Will you pay the price asked of you, or will you leave this place unenlightened?",
ORO_MATO,"That Nail Art... you have been training with my brother Mato.<page>He has strange notions of loyalty and honour. I'm sure he was difficult and unpleasant to train under.<page>Did he mention my name to you? If he does, tell him to be patient. He'll be waiting a while longer before I give him what he wants.",
ORO_SLY,"That charm you bear... It seems the Great Nailsage has deemed you skilled enough in the Nail Arts to earn his highest esteem.<page>I do not begrudge you his love. You have earned it.<page>And perhaps by helping you along your path, I have redeemed myself... if only a little.",
ORO_MEET,"Hmph. How did you find me, down here where the world ends?<page>Yes, I know why you're here. You came to learn a Nail Art from the legendary Nailmaster Oro.<page>It is the law of the Great Nailsage that I must pass down my teachings to those who are worthy.<page>But no law forbids me from exacting a payment for my time. If you truly wish to train under me, prove it with Geo!",
SHEO_DREAM,"My brother, Oro... what drove you to hide away deep down at the very edge of that ash swept grave?<page>Was it pride, or fear, or shame? Perhaps you should lay down your nail if it haunts you so, and find a new calling that eases your soul.",
SHEO_ART,"Something about your bearing... I feel as though you haven't yet abandoned the way of the nail. I can teach you something, if you like... ",
MATO_MEET,"Hm? Ah, well met! Yes, I thought I could sense the aura of a fierce warrior approaching.<page>I'm impressed you found my sanctuary here at the top of the world. No doubt you've endured many trials and overcome many foes in your quest to find me.<page>No, don't speak a word. I, Nailmaster Mato, who was taught the Art of the Nail by the Great Nailsage himself, hereby accept you as my pupil! Let us begin the lesson immediately!",
SHEO_REFUSE,"Oh? Have you, too, grown weary of the weight of a nail? I understand. Stay, if you like, and we can make art together.",
SHEO_MEET,"A visitor! Why have you crept in here, little grub? Perhaps, like me, you have a taste for discovering new things?<page>I am Sheo, and in a previous life I was a Nailmaster. Yes, the only thing that drove me was becoming stronger and honing my skills with a nail.<page>I imagined it was my one calling in life, but that feeling faded over time. Now I seek a new calling, something that speaks to my soul and compels me forward.<page>That's why I spend my time here, secluded, trying to master the art of creation. Painting, sculpting... these things bring a different kind of pleasure.<page>Mmm. You don't seem very moved by what I've said. Was it Sheo the Nailmaster you were looking for? Did you come to learn a Nail Art? I'll teach you if you insist...",
MATO_TAUGHT,"Your form... exquisite! Now I know how my own master felt when he passed down his teachings to us.<page>I hope you don't think me too forward when I say that I consider you to be my child. Yes! When I saw you perform my Nail Art I felt a bond between us suddenly flash into existence!<page>You honour me beyond words, my pupil...<page>Thank you.",
SHEO_ORO,"So you met my brother Oro and convinced him to teach you his Nail Art. Hmm.<page>It's been a long time since I've seen him. I wonder how much he's changed. He always seemed to be haunted by something, though I never learned what.<page>No matter the distance between us though, we are still brothers. I hope that passing down his learnings to you brought him some happiness.",
SHEO_TAUGHT,"So! My work, does it move you?<page>The wielding of a nail, the wielding of a brush... these things are not so different.<page>We cut into the world so that we can peer deeper inside.<page>For now though, I have nothing more to teach you. Your path forwards... only you can see it. Good luck.",
