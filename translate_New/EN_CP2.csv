DIVINE_NOTENOUGH,No Geo... why? Why don't you have enough Geo?,
GRIMMSYCOPHANT_INSPECT,The corpse of a large bug.,
ISELDA_GRIMM,"Have you seen them? The travellers who set up camp outside of town?<page>I was interested at first, not a lot has been happening lately. But they have a... sinister feeling to them. You can feel it, right?<page>I've told Cornifer he's not to speak to them. His heart and his mind are a little too open sometimes.",
PROMPT_FRAGILE_HEART,Give Fragile Heart charm?,
IGOR_FINAL,...Mrmm.<page>Very good. The child burns with flame.<page>Master... is waiting for you. Mrmm.,
QUEEN_GRIMMCHILD,"Ahh, that creature beside. It would be naive to claim it friend, though you two share a... similarity? It is a distant link, one words would strain to convey.<page>For it to cling to you now... You've been consumed in the Ritual of that scarlet clan.<page>In what poor moment they descend upon our ruin. Aid their propagation, if you so choose, but do not renege on the larger task this kingdom implores.",
DIVINE_OFFER_2,"Again...? You're so greedy for gifts! Poor little lovely. Give me your Geo, and I will give you your gift.",
BRUMM_REMINDER,You wish to see the Master? Return with the child full of flame and he shall appear.,
GRIMM_BATTLE_3,"Dance with me, my friend. The crowd awaits. Show them you are worthy of a starring role!",
GRIMMSYCOPHANT_DREAM,Master... my role.... apart from you... apart from kin. It pains me so.,
GRIMM_DEFEAT_3,Go out into the darkness. Harvest the last lingering embers of this Kingdom. Then return to me and we will complete our dance.,
BRETTA_DIARY_LEAVE,"                          The Maiden's Quest<br>Her Grey Prince diminished and her White Saviour revealed as beast, the Maiden at last understood the truth.<page>Her life's companion would not appear, for they could not appear to a maiden sat idle. She must instead seek them out, must find her love, and free them of their solitude.<page>And thus her own journey began, out into dangerous lands, shielded by her love awaiting, guided by her love to be.<page>With every step, the maiden could feel it, their fated meeting, coming ever closer. ",
ELDERBUG_GRIMM_DREAM,Why must these grotesque strangers intrude on our peaceful little home? Sometimes it feels like the whole world is conspiring to make me uncomfortable.,
BRUMM_DEEPNEST_4,"It is done... and yet...<page>It is not merely by fortune that we meet here, in the darkest, furthest reaches of the world, where my Master's scarlet eyes can not see us.<page>Mrmm. A song that never ends... is no song at all.<page>You take part in the Ritual, yet I sense you truly have no Master. Is it so? Perhaps together we can banish that livid flame and let this dead Kingdom rest in peace.<page>If you wish to silence the endless song... Mrmm, meet me where it began.<page>But if you return to the Master and complete the Ritual... Mrmm. As long as you do it without regret, I will bear you no hatred.",
PROMPT_DIVINE_GIFT,Pay to get a gift?,
NYMM_REPEAT,"My dear friend, are you enjoying my music? It's as upbeat a tune as I know, but I must admit, even it falls a little on the sadder side.<page>Please know I play it with joy. Being in this town, beside such good company as yourself, I feel remarkably, refreshingly content.",
MIDWIFE_WEAVERSONG_DREAM,"Just because you're suddenly rich with threaded friends, don't think you're welcome in my mind! Out! Out! Out!",
DIVINE_REFUSE,"Eeuuarrggh! Why?!<page>Little lovely, don't do nasty things. Don't be cruel. Show it to me! That beautiful thing was made for me... I can smell it!",
BRUMM_LANTERN,"So you followed me here, to where the Ritual began. You would join me in breaking it then?<page>It is painful to defy the Master, but our harvest... it profanes this dark, quiet Kingdom. This once, I would see the Ritual fail.<page>Mrmm.. Now! Let us destroy the anchor, and banish the Master. Never shall he return here again!",
DIVINE_GRIMM_DEPARTED,"Ahhh! Then the Ritual is complete? And the Master has... moved on? Has he? Perhaps, not?<page>Ahhh, but more for me. Still more I can do. Gifts, so lovely! Aaaahh. Master would understand.",
GRIMM_DEFEAT_1,"Bravo, my friend. Hear how the crowd adores you! They've not seen such a show in a long time.",
GRIMM_DREAM,"Masterful! Even a vessel discarded bears fierce strength.<page>Fine craft dear Wyrm, and perfect tool to prolong the heart of Grimm.",
BRUMM_DREAM_DEEPNEST,Yes. We are merely vessels for the flame. But... were we always empty?,
ELDERBUG_BRETTA_LEAVE,"That young lass! Why, she's up and departed over the cliffs, with only the briefest word of farewell.<page>It's a perilous journey she's set herself upon. I can't understand where she gained such fortitude.<page>I'd thought her a timid sort, one after my own mind... How wrong I was. The call of adventure lures all but me!",
DIVINE_HAS_CHARM,"That smell! Eeuuarrggh! You're hiding something very nice from me, aren't you? Shouldn't hide something so nice!<page>Show me... show me! Put it on! Quickly!",
DIVINE_EATEN2,"The one who made my gift... Aahhh, somewhere below? Yes?<page>Very good gift. Very tasty! Delicious!",
LEG_EATER_GOLD1,"Eaurgh... Eaaauuurrgggh?!<page>My charm! What did you do to it?! The smell... different. Strange, but nice. Very nice!<page>That smell... talks to me. Someone, somewhere... very nice.",
GRIMM_RITUAL_COMPLETE,"Across these lands my kin now spread, harvesting that essence peculiar to my... breed, the flame in dream.<page>Seek my kin; claim their flame and return it to me. Together, marvels shall be achieved.<page>But don't fret small one. For this task you won't travel alone. My child shall guide you to the flame and gather within itself that burning essence.<page>Like you, the child plays key role in this task. Only with it by your side will the flame, and my kin, reveal themselves to you.",
UI_CHARM_LOST,Charm Lost,
BRUMM_DEEPNEST_2,"Endless, repeating songs of sacrifice, of servitude. For the Ritual. For the troupe. For the Master.<page>Even this child was born into invisible chains. Mrmm.",
NYMM_DREAM,Hmm...Why did I choose to travel here? And how far must I have come... to forget the origin entirely.,
IGOR_SPEAK,...Mrmm.<page>Speak to Master.,
NYMM_MEET,"Ah. Hello! Hello! I'm new around these parts, so it's marvelous to see so friendly a face, in such a sad town.<page>The old bug over there was very welcoming, but still I find the place a little melancholy, what with the wind, and the darkness, and the sense of decline... I was hoping my music could go some way to livening up the place.<page>And now you've arrived with that wonderful, charming aura about you. The whole town feels brighter for it.<page>Before you hurry about your business, I've a small gift to commemorate a wonderful new friendship. No use for it myself, but I believe it'd look rather fancy upon you.<page>Please, enjoy it, and lets hope to see much more of one another about town.",
DIVINE_GIFT_REFUSE,"Eeuuarrggh! Refuse me, then!",
NYMM_BRUMM_CHARM,"Ahh. Just marvelous! I'm so glad you'd consider my gift worth wearing, and my, my, it does suit you well.<page>To be honest, I'm not even sure where I came upon it, but staring at its design, my memory stirs, something, and someone, forgotten, lost far away.<page>The specifics elude me, but a strange sense remains, fear, but also... longing? Like a strange nostalgia for something that never happened.<page>I've no need for it in any case, so I'm glad you're enjoying it.",
GRIMMSTEED_DREAM_1,A new land. Different from the last. How many more will we see?,
ELDERBUG_NYMM,"Ah ha! Good riddance! That creepy carnival has vanished and town's returned to its former self, nice and quiet as I like it.<page>And we've gained a new addition to the square! I found the fellow just outside of town. Seemed a little confused at first. Claims to be from far away, though he's hazy on the details.<page>Whatever his past, he's a rather good musician, and this town's spent far too long listening only to the wind. Thanks to him, we've gained a new tune and some new company!",
SLY_GRIMM,"I've been hearing about the strangers that have come to town. They're strange indeed from what's been told.<page>What interest does this tired little place hold for them? I'm thinking you may know the answer to that.<page>None of my business of course, but I'd be wary of their deals and promises. Keep your nail half-drawn, if you understand me.",
GRIMM_BATTLE_1,Wonderful. Wonderful! My kin arrive and the time has come.,
IGOR_FLAME,The flame. Seek it out.<page>For Master. For our kin. Mrmm.,
BRUMM_DEEPNEST_REPEAT,"If you wish to silence this endless song, meet me where it began...<page>But if you wish to continue the Ritual... Mrmm. As long as you do it without regret, I will bear you no hatred.",
PROMPT_FRAGILE_STRENGTH,Give Fragile Strength charm?,
DIVINE_REOFFER,You want a gift. Greedy! Give me Geo and you will get a gift...,
DIVINE_EATEN,"Beautiful, delicious... Ahhhhhh!<page>You're good, little lovely. You're very sweet, to bring me such a gift!",
LEG_EATER_GOLD3,"Eaurgh... Eaaauuurrgggh!! Eaauurggh!<page>Those charms... that smell! So so much! I want to... yesss!<page>I know where you are now. Above me. Much above me, but I know where to go. I will come! Don't try to hide from me!",
GRIMM_ACCEPT,"As the lantern flared your role was cast, our compact written in scarlet fire.<page>Eager we are to see you commence, but first, some illumination is required.",
QUEEN_GRIMMCHILD_FULL,"Your companion's eyes burn with a familiar flame... Success then for the scarlet heart, and irony, to use my spawn to grow its own.<page>I know you creature, and the form time shall bring. You may be all and one, clan and master, but this land shall never bear so foreign a king.",
DIVINE_EATEN4,"A gift? For you? So greedy!<page>But... I can show you something if you're nice to me, little lovely. Will you do a nice thing, lovely?<page>Give them to me... your Geo. Give me your Geo and I'll give you a gift.",
DIVINE_FINAL_REPEAT,"That's enough. Enough! I'm feeling very happy now.<page>Aaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! Now, I can follow Master...",
DIVINE_ALL_EATEN,"Ahhhhh. Such beautiful, special gifts. So lovely!<page>I'm ready now. Very ready!<page>My smell... you'll carry it with you, then?",
BRUMM_LANTERN_DREAM,"Master... are even you a slave? If so, let our chains be broken together!",
ISELDA_NYMM,"A stylish fellow's made his way to town. Normally I'm wary of musicians, all pomp and ego.<page>This one seems okay... and he's not asked for any Geo just yet. Let's hope it stays that way.",
PLAQUE_WARN,"To witness secrets sealed, one must endure the harshest punishment.",
BRETTA_MZOTE_02,Grey Prince? You seem... smaller? Were you always so tattered and stained...?,
BRETTA_MZOTE_01,"Grey Prince? Your words, are they... repeating? ",
DIVINE_EAT,"Aaaahhhhhhhhhhhh! So good! So tasty! A perfect, perfect thing, just for me! Ahhhhhh!",
BRUMM_DEEPNEST_1,"Mrmm. You came.<page>The red flame I've gathered from this dead Kingdom. You would claim it... for our Master. For his final act.<page>The Ritual plays itself out once more. We are like the notes in an old, old song. You and me. Mrmm.",
JIJI_GRIMM,"Hmm. A fierce host has settled nearby. Did you summon them? I find their smell... unsettling.<page>Theirs is a scent of distant places, unfamiliar even to me.<page>They have a strange look to them, gaudy and intimidating. Perhaps you suspect they hide their true appearance? You'd be right. They favour projection over truth, shrouding themselves in forms dreamed.<page>Best be careful. Assisting them might benefit you, but who knows what suffering it may cause?",
DIVINE_CONVO_1,"You carry a lot of smells on you, but you don't have one of your own. Funny little thing...",
GRIMM_DEFEAT_2,"Look here! How our child has grown, nourished and strengthened by the heat of our passionate dance!<page>The two of you will feature in many tragedies and triumphs together, I'm sure.<page>And so our great Ritual nears its end. Will you continue to harvest the flame, even though now you surely see the path it illuminates for us?<page>Our scarlet eyes will watch you keenly... friend.",
ELDERBUG_TROUPE_LEFT,"Ah ha! Good riddance! That creepy carnival has vanished and the town's returned to its former self, nice and quiet as I like it.<page>It's quite enough to deal with just the occasional traveller. Whole structures appearing out of nowhere, dreadful music, horrific masks, all far more than one old bug should have to face.",
IGOR_DREAM,When flame burns bright inside one's mind<br>Kin heed the call 'cross lands and time.,
BRUMM_DEEPNEST_3,"So we serve... Thus it has ever been. Yes?<page>Take the flame then, it is why you came here.",
MIDWIFE_WEAVERSONG,"Ohhhh.. Heehee. Been prying about the weavers' home, have you my dear? Quite brazen to pilfer that special charm.<page>Amazing things the weavers once crafted on their looms; stories, shields, spells. So much of our history was spun upon their spools. Your little friends there are testament to their talents... heehee.<page>Oh! I do apologise. I've just felt a rumbling down below, in my belly. Just wait right there a moment. Don't you move now...",
GRIMMSTEED_DREAM_2,"The roads between are dark and long, but the Master's light will always guide us.",
DIVINE_GIVE,Ahhhhhhhhhh! Ahhhh!<page>Such a little beauty! Such a smell... such a smell! Ahhh!,
GRIMM_LEVELUP_1,I can feel it. The warmth of the flame you've gathered together.,
IGOR_MEET,Mrmm. You called us?<page>Speak to Master.,
DIVINE_DREAM_LEGEATER,"The most exquisite things I've ever experienced! Ahhhhh!<page>I'll take them with me... precious, precious memories of you! Precious tastes and smells!",
DIVINE_FINAL,"One final gift! Ahhhhhhhh!<page>I liked it very much. Very, very good. So good!<page>Eaaauuurrgggh!! Eaauurggh! Now, I can follow Master...",
GRIMM_BATTLE_2,This searing fire... It carries well the Ritual's promise.,
GRIMM_LEVELUP_3,"Beautiful, yes. The child has grown, from idle youth to deadly companion. About these dangerous lands, its aid will no doubt be welcome.<page> Just don't neglect our dance, for it too continues! Keep hunting that scattered, scarlet essence.<page>When the child is filled with flame once more, return to the stage and the performance will begin. ",
GRIMM_LEVELUP_2,"A masterful opening act. The air hums with excitement.<page>Dear child, you've done so well. Let your fire burn even brighter!",
GRIMM_MEET1,"So, it was you who called us.",
PROMPT_FRAGILE_GREED,Give Fragile Greed charm?,
GRIMM_MEET2,"Well met, my friend. Well met. I am Grimm, master of this troupe.<page>The lantern has been lit, and your summons heeded. A fine stage you choose, this kingdom fallowed by worm and root, perfect earth upon which our Ritual shall take place.<page>And you, my friend. Your own part is far from over.",
BRUMM_DEEPNEST_NF_1,"Mrmm. You came.<page>You have gathered the flame and so the time for the ritual's completion is upon us. All you must do now is return to the Master...<page>Thus it goes, as it ever has. We are like the notes in an old, old song. You and me. Mrmm.<page>And yet... It is not merely by fortune that we meet here, in the darkest, furthest reaches of the world, where my Master's scarlet eyes can not see us.<page>Mrmm. A song that never ends... is no song at all.<page>You take part in the Ritual, yet I sense you truly have no Master. Is it so? Perhaps together we can banish that livid flame and let this dead Kingdom rest in peace.<page>If you wish to silence the endless song... Mrmm, meet me where it began... ",
DIVINE_CHARM_EQUIPPED,"Aaaaaaaaahhhhhhhh!<page>That charm... beautiful! Most precious thing! Little lovely, will you let me see it? Have to show it to me! ",
ELDERBUG_GRIMM,"Ahh! Look there! Something strange and sinister has suddenly appeared!<page>Ugh, it fills me with dread. I think it best I try to ignore it. ",
LEG_EATER_GOLD_REPEAT,"I know where you are now. Above me. Much above me, but I know where to go. I will come! Don't try to hide from me!",
DIVINE_DREAM,"Shadow and fire will dance together so prettily, I think...",
DIVINE_MEET,"Aaaaaaaaahhhhhhhh!<page>Did you call us? You called us, and we came. We came!<page>You don't look scared. Why did you call us?<page>Ahhh. It doesn't matter. Don't tell me.<page>We came, and I can smell something. Something deep below us. I want it... I want it!",
NYMM_FINAL,"Dear friend, I heard a violent scream from below. Even my song could not mask such a horrible shriek. Was it pain, or rage? I find I'm rather sensitive to such things.<page>If you're planning to head down, please do stay safe. I'd be dreadfully upset if I forever lost your company.",
DIVINE_CHARM_EQUIPPED_2,"Aaaaahhhhhhh! I can smell it! Another gift, made for me. Give it to me!",
DIVINE_EATEN3,"Do you want something, little lovely? You don't want to take my gift back, do you?<page>Eeuuarrggh! So nasty, so cruel, if that's true! Once you give something as a gift it's lost to you forever!",
MOTHSTONE_DREAM,Protect yourself... You are our last...,
SLY_NYMM,"Another bug's arrived. And quite a racket he's making in the square. Worse, he's not a Geo to his name! Only that blasted, squealing instrument.<page>Why is it always the poor that decide to stay?",
DIVINE_RECEIVED_GIFT,"You like it very much, don't you? Your gift. You're lucky to carry such a smell with you!<page>Eeeuuaaarrrrggh!",
