Only two obvious outcomes there are from such a thing.<page>The first is inevitable on current course, regression, all minds relinquished to that pernicious plague.<page>The second I find preferable, and would seek your aid in its occurance, replacement.<page>I implore you, usurp the Vessel.

EMILITIA_KING_BRAND,"Oh... hmm... Could it be? You've returned at last? No. No... <page>Oh pardon me! For just a moment, I mistook a certain quality about you. You seemed almost... regal. <page>Silly, I know. It's clear you're not of high birth, wandering about all dirty and tattered like that. ",
