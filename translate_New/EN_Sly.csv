SLY_GENERIC,"Pockets feeling empty? If you need some more Geo, take a trip into the ruins below us and hunt around. Just take care not to fall into a haze. I won't be coming down to rescue you.",
SLY_GENERIC_NM,"How are your travels, Nailmaster? As time goes by, I'm sure you'll only grow stronger.<page>If you see your fellow Nailmasters again, tell them I carry them in my thoughts always. And that they should come and buy something from their old teacher as a mark of respect.",
SLY_NAIL_HONED,"You've found a new nail, then? It looks like a much finer weapon than the last.<page>Hmm? Oh, this is the same nail... but it's been honed! By someone extremely skilled...<page>A nail is an extension of ourselves, it is the instrument by which we shape the world around us. It's a sacred duty to keep its edges sharp.<page>...Heh, sorry. I shouldn't ramble on like that. Let's talk Geo instead.",
SLY_MAPPER,I see they've opened that mapping shop across the way. I suppose a little competition is healthy.<page>Perhaps I should start to sell maps as well... or is that a little aggressive? Heh. All's fair in a world made of Geo.,
SLY_DREAM_STORE,...Wherever you are... Whatever it is you do now... I hope you three are looking after yourselves...,
SLY_BASEMENT_1,"...So, another would join our group.",
SLY_NOSTOCK_2,"Back again? You know I haven't any stock left, yes? You've cleaned me out.<page>Or were you hoping to sneak a peek at my mountain of Geo? Well it's mine now! And fairly traded. ",
SLY_RESCUE_REPEAT,"You're exploring then? Very brave! Plenty of courageous wanderers have been lost to the hunger of these old caverns.<page>You have your nail though, and I can tell just by looking that you know how to wield it.",
SLY_RESCUE_1,"...ugghh, Oro you oaf.... You wield your nail... like a club...<page>...Esmy... how much deeper do we have to go...",
SLY_NAILART,"Hmm, you seem a little different. Something has changed in your bearing.<page>Ah! The way you hold your nail! So you've learnt a Nail Art...<page>Very interesting. I wonder, do you have the passion to continue your training?",
SLY_DREAM_BASEMENT,...These refined weapons...The battles of Geo are much deadlier...,
SLY_SHOP_INTRO,"Ah, hello! I knew we'd meet again. How do you like my cosy little store? I've made myself pretty comfortable here, selling old trinkets to travellers like yourself.<page>If you're planning a trip below, I've several items that may improve your chance of survival.",
SLY_BASEMENT_2,"I have a gift for you, warrior. As a shopkeeper, I admit parting with it for free is rather difficult.<page>But as the Great Nailsage I must recognise your skill. You have mastered the arts of my remaining pupils. Now tradition decrees you too may hold the symbol.",
SLY_RESCUE_3,"I'm Sly. Usually, I live an uneventful life up in Dirtmouth. The air in these ruins doesn't agree with me, so I'd best be getting back.<page>If you return above, come and see me. I'm probably the friendliest face left there, and I can thank you properly for your good deed.",
SLY_RESCUE_2,"Oh! What?! Who are you?!<page>...I see. This old village. What a strange dream, to have led me down here! If you hadn't found me, I don't think I would've ever woken.",
SLY_DREAM_RUINS,...Geo. Geo. All the world is Geo. No nail can withstand its might...,
SLY_KEY_2,"What do you have there? Why, that's the key to my storeroom! I thought I'd lost it for good.<page>Hmm? Did you find it in those old mines perhaps? Very curious. I've no idea how it ended up in such a remote place.<page>Very honest of you to return it to me, yes. Very kind. And now that I can open my old storeroom up, I can sell you some of the rare stock that's been gathering dust in there.<page>These items may be a little time-worn, but they still retain their full market value. Very precious stuff! Take a look... ",

SLY_BASEMENT_REPEAT,Off you go Nailmaster. I've nothing more to give you...<page>Nothing for free at least. I'll be up briefly and eager take your Geo in trade for my precious wares.,
SLY_NOSTOCK_1,"Ah, still looking for something to buy? Is your Geo weighing you down? Unfortunately, you seem to have cleared out everything I'd be willing to part with. Nothing left at all!<page>I think there might be a few old trinkets down in my storeroom, but I lost the key a while ago.<page>So, no more business between us I'm afraid! For now at least. Get out of here and let me spend some quality time with all the Geo you've gifted me.",
SLY_BASEMENT_3,"Wear it proudly, Nailmaster. You shall be the last to receive its like.",
