ISELDA_MEET,"Come to buy a map have you? It's really my husband you should be dealing with, but what a surprise! He's headed down below.<page>He'll pop back occasionally to deliver new maps for the store but I do wish he'd spend a little more time up here. I've not much interest in retail myself.<page>Now, let's see what's here for me to sell.",
ISELDA_REPEAT,"Are you enjoying yourself down in the ruins? At times my husband makes Hallownest sound a wonder, but sometimes it seems a ghastly, dangerous place.",
ISELDA_DREAM,"I'm glad I put down my weapon, this quiet life with Corny makes me a lot happier. It would be nice to stretch my legs again though... sometime soon...",

ISELDA_GREET1,"Of all the places to end up, we've picked this dreary town. I'd thought it a temporary stop, then my husband became obsessed with that old ruin.<page>Now he's spending all his time down there. He argues cartography is sound business, but other than you, who's buying?",
ISELDA_CORNIFER_HOME,"Cornifer's home at last, but look at him, he's exhausted. He always does this, furiously charts a place, then collapses once he's done.<page>He'll be sleeping for some time I imagine, so even with him home, I'm still lost for company.<page>Ahhh, but I do love the bug, even his faults. Seeing his passion for maps, it's something of an inspiration.<page>Corny keeps asking me to join him on his adventures and I've always declined. Maybe next time I should accept the offer?",
ISELDA_NOSTOCK,"After more supplies? You've already bought so much. Unfortunately for now, you've cleaned us out of anything worth selling.<page>Cornifer will no doubt be pleased, though I do wonder what he plans to spend all that Geo on. ",
ISELDA_GHOSTPIN,"Corny was telling me of some distinctive graves and shrines about the kingdom. I've made a new pin to represent them.<page>This one was quite challenging to make, and I laboured over the details. It's a nice result so I think it's worth a little more.",
ISELDA_TRAMPIN,"Apparently Hallownest has giant metal carriages called trams? Sounds unecessary to me, given those old stag lines that Corny always talks about.<page>Still, I've made a pin to represent a tram station. Might be useful if you're inclined to make your map more detailed.<page>It wasn't too hard to make, so I'm not charging a premium for it.",
ISELDA_DREAMTREE,"My husband mentioned some strange roots that grow about the kingdom and suggested I make a pin to mark them.<page>Cornifer thinks my pin's depiction look grander than the sad limp thing he comes across, but I figure, that's not a bad thing. Who'd want to buy a pin of a limp root?",
