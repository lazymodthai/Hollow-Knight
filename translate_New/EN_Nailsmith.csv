NAILSMITH_MEET_1,"Have you brought me another nail to be honed? Leave it on the ground and return later, if you're still breathing.",
NAILSMITH_DECLINE,"You're not interested, then? Suit yourself.",
ART_DREAM,....An age spent toiling alone... this is much nicer...,
MODELLING,"We're building a full suite of the Kingdom's Knights. In their time, I barely ever paid them attention, but Sheo keenly remembers each.<page>It's so refreshing. Nothing like the crude practice of Nailwork. I just love all the intricate details.",
NAILSMITH_OFFER,"If you'd like, I can reforge your nail. It'll make the blade far more deadly.",
NAILSMITH_COMPLETE_3,Here we are. The reforging is complete.<page>I've modified the nail to spiral form. A very tricky task it was. You'll find it stronger than ever before.<page>Off you go now. Cut your way forward.,
NAILSMITH_GREET,"Hmm? Oh, you've returned.",
NAILSMITH_COMPLETE_1,There we go. The reforging is complete.<page>I've honed your nail's edge. You'll find it much stronger than it used to be.<page>Head out there and test its strength against your foes.,

NAILSMITH_COMPLETE_4,"It's done. The reforging is done.<page>Your nail is much stronger than it used to be. As strong as it could ever be.<page>In only your weapon have I seen such potential. Finally, I behold the majesty of a Pure Nail. <page>To think this moment has come upon me so soon...<page>...I... I must step outside a moment...",
NAILSMITH_COMPLETE_2,There we go. The reforging is complete.<page>I've added a channel to your nail. It should cut much more efficiently. You'll find it stronger than it used to be.<page>Head out there and test its blade against your foes.,
NAILSMITH_REGREET,Hmm? You're still here. Is there something else you want?,
NAILSMITH_ACCEPT,As you wish. I'll get to work then.,
NAILSMITH_KILL_REPEAT,Do not hesitate. I beg you. Cut me down! I want to taste that blade's exquisite edge.,
ART_MEET,"Hmm? Oh, hello traveller. How strange that we should meet again in a world as vast as this.<page>I must thank you for not killing me when I asked you to. I was irritated at first, but I had some time to think up there and I soon saw the wisdom in your decision.<page>The world is made of more than metal and weapons. I set out exploring, and soon found my way here.<page>Sheo is a master of many arts, and has promised to teach me what he can. I think I'll be quite happy here.",
NAILSMITH_SIGN,Unused,

As my final moment in life, I want to taste the blade's exquisite edge.<page>After all this time, all this toil... haven't I earned it?",
NAILSMITH_NOT_ENOUGH_GEO,"Ah, you don't have the Geo? Come and see me when you do.",
NAILSMITH_MEET_3,"After a Nailsmith are you? Well you've found one. I'm not much for talk, but if its a nail that needs repair then you've come to the right bug.<page>Your own nail is in quite a sorry state. It's obviously not one of mine. Still, anything can be refined with enough effort and skill, even that broken blade.",
NAILSMITH_OFFER_ORE,"I see you have some Pale Ore. A rare, fine metal, that. Give me the ore and some Geo for my efforts, and I'll reforge your nail to make it stronger.",
PAINTED,"I'm afraid I can't speak at length. If I move too much, Sheo's masterwork will be ruined and I'd hate to see him upset.<page>Though he may seem imposing, in truth he's a delicate sort.",
NAILSMITH_DREAM_CLIFF,My life's work achieved... What more is left...?,
NAILSMITH_MEET_2,Hmm?<page>Oh. I thought you were someone else.,
