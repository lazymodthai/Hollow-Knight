<entry name="ISELDA_MEET">Come to buy a map have you? It's really my husband you should be dealing with, but what a surprise! He's headed down below.&lt;page&gt;He'll pop back occasionally to deliver new maps for the store but I do wish he'd spend a little more time up here. I've not much interest in retail myself.&lt;page&gt;Now, let's see what's here for me to sell.</entry>
<entry name="ISELDA_REPEAT">Are you enjoying yourself down in the ruins? At times my husband makes Hallownest sound a wonder, but sometimes it seems a ghastly, dangerous place.</entry>
<entry name="ISELDA_DREAM">I'm glad I put down my weapon, this quiet life with Corny makes me a lot happier. It would be nice to stretch my legs again though... sometime soon...</entry>

<entry name="ISELDA_GREET1">Of all the places to end up, we've picked this dreary town. I'd thought it a temporary stop, then my husband became obsessed with that old ruin.&lt;page&gt;Now he's spending all his time down there. He argues cartography is sound business, but other than you, who's buying?</entry>
<entry name="ISELDA_CORNIFER_HOME">Cornifer's home at last, but look at him, he's exhausted. He always does this, furiously charts a place, then collapses once he's done.&lt;page&gt;He'll be sleeping for some time I imagine, so even with him home, I'm still lost for company.&lt;page&gt;Ahhh, but I do love the bug, even his faults. Seeing his passion for maps, it's something of an inspiration.&lt;page&gt;Corny keeps asking me to join him on his adventures and I've always declined. Maybe next time I should accept the offer?</entry>
<entry name="ISELDA_NOSTOCK">After more supplies? You've already bought so much. Unfortunately for now, you've cleaned us out of anything worth selling.&lt;page&gt;Cornifer will no doubt be pleased, though I do wonder what he plans to spend all that Geo on. </entry>
<entry name="ISELDA_GHOSTPIN">Corny was telling me of some distinctive graves and shrines about the kingdom. I've made a new pin to represent them.&lt;page&gt;This one was quite challenging to make, and I laboured over the details. It's a nice result so I think it's worth a little more.</entry>
<entry name="ISELDA_TRAMPIN">Apparently Hallownest has giant metal carriages called trams? Sounds unecessary to me, given those old stag lines that Corny always talks about.&lt;page&gt;Still, I've made a pin to represent a tram station. Might be useful if you're inclined to make your map more detailed.&lt;page&gt;It wasn't too hard to make, so I'm not charging a premium for it.</entry>
<entry name="ISELDA_DREAMTREE">My husband mentioned some strange roots that grow about the kingdom and suggested I make a pin to mark them.&lt;page&gt;Cornifer thinks my pin's depiction look grander than the sad limp thing he comes across, but I figure, that's not a bad thing. Who'd want to buy a pin of a limp root?</entry>
