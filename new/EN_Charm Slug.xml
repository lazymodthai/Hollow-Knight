<entry name="CHARMSLUG_TRUTH">My dapper gadfly, would you care to know how charms are made? I don't often tell my customers, what with the truth being a little morbid. But you're a sharp one so you may have guessed already.&lt;page&gt;Few ways a charm appears but mainly it's from final wish, a dying bug's potent desire crystallised into these gorgeous, powerful trinkets.&lt;page&gt;Now don't go getting too sad. There are exceptions of course, and really, it's quite beautiful, makes them all the more precious. Mmhhmm.&lt;page&gt;Just think of all the little bug souls that went into creating your collection! It's like a crowd of strangers in your pouch, or purse, or...err....wherever it is you keep them.</entry>
<entry name="CHARMSLUG_DREAM">...Dear dear, I really must hold it together, must appear calm, but this creature... is just divine...</entry>
<entry name="CHARMSLUG_MEET_3A">Mmm... What were we talking about? Oh yes, Charms! I can see you've started your own collection. Very nice! I'll show you some of my own, and you can take one home with you if you like!</entry>
<entry name="CHARMSLUG_MEET_1">Ooooooooooooohhhhhhh, you surprised me! Hello, hello! Come in, sweetling! Come in and make yourself at home.</entry>
<entry name="CHARMSLUG_MEET_3B">Mmm... What were we talking about? Oh yes, Charms! I'm surprised a stylish little gadfly like yourself isn't wearing any, actually.&lt;page&gt;Charms are gorgeous, mystical, one-of-a-kind accessories with a spark of power woven into their cores. Just wearing one is enough to change your life! You'll do things you never thought possible!&lt;page&gt;Take a look at some of the Charms I have for sale. You can take one home with you if you like!</entry>
<entry name="CHARMSLUG_OVERCHARM">It's a bit of a sin to wear too many Charms at once, isn't it? Sometimes less is more! Mmmm!&lt;page&gt;Yes, you shouldn't try to cram on more Charms than you can handle. The effect could be positively overwhelming!</entry>
<entry name="CHARMSLUG_COMBO">Do you wear a lot of Charms at once? It's a lot of fun isn't it, mixing and matching them to get the perfect combination?&lt;page&gt;I don't know whether you've noticed, but some Charms seem to like each other. Yes! Mmm! When Charms like each other, they shine even brighter and sing even more sweetly!&lt;page&gt;Even more reason to try all sorts of fun and surprising combinations of Charms! Mmmmmmm! You'll show me whenever you have a new favourite, right?</entry>
<entry name="CHARMSLUG_BLESSING_1">My dear. A blessing for you. With your excessive patronage and those startling good looks, you've more than earned it. </entry>
<entry name="CHARMSLUG_NOSTOCK">Goodness, goodness. You've gone and bought all my lovely charms! What a stunning, colourful collection you've amassed. Mmmmmm! You're even more the attractive bug, clad in all those wonderful, sparkling things.&lt;page&gt;I may have nothing more to give, but you must come back and visit from time to time. Such a dashing figure frequenting my store. I bet the whole village is jealous. Mmm hmm!</entry>
<entry name="CHARMSLUG_MEET_2">I'm Salubra, and this is my cosy little Charm store. Did the townfolk out there tell you to come and visit me? Mmm, yes! This is a lovely little village isn't it? Warm and intimate and full of life.</entry>
<entry name="CHARMSLUG_NOTCH_AVAIL_1">Ooooooooooooohhhhhhh, you're building up quite the Charm collection, aren't you? Quite the little connoisseur. I'd bet you'd like to wear more Charms at once, hmm? I've got a special item for sale that I think you'll be very, verrrry interested in! Mmm! </entry>
<entry name="CHARMSLUG_NOTCH_AVAIL_2">Oooohhhh! You flamboyant little gadfly! Your Charm collection has expanded quite a bit, hasn't it? I think it's about time you bought another Notch so you can wear more Charms at once. Go on... spoil yourself! Mmmm!</entry>
<entry name="CHARMSLUG_NOTCH_AVAIL_3">Oooohhhh! Your charm collection is getting positively enormous! I'm so jealous! I think it's about time you bought another Notch so you can wear more Charms at once. Go on... spoil yourself! Mmmm!</entry>
<entry name="CHARMSLUG_NOTCH_AVAIL_4">Mmmmmmmmm! Look at you! Every time I see you, you've collected even more Charms! I think it's about time you bought another Notch so you can wear more Charms at once. Go on... spoil yourself! Mmmm!</entry>
<entry name="CHARMSLUG_BLESSING_2">Mmmmmm yess... I hope my blessing brings you everything you desire! Don't be a stranger sweetums.</entry>
<entry name="CHARMSLUG_REPEAT">It's rare enough that someone enters my store, but even rarer to meet one so striking!&lt;page&gt;Those impressive horns! That fierce weapon. The air of mystery! Ooooh. It's enough to make me swoon.</entry>
